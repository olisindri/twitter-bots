Prison of my soul

I'm Trapped in a prison
where nobody loves me
and noone even cares
where's my knight in shining armour
I want him to come
but he isn't even on the way
he isn't even close
'cause I'm trapped in a prison
a prison of my mind

 
I'm trapped in a prison
and I can't see no light
Where is Jesus the loving light
I need him here, but I can't hear
he's rapping on the door
the door to my heart
he opens up the prison
the prison of my soul
