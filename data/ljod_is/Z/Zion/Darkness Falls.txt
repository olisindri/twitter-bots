Darkness Falls

Darkness falls upon
my face,
the light it leaves
without a trace.
Darkness falls
upon my face,
makes my heart,
lose all it's grace

The sun comes up
and filles my heart.
My soul no more
is falling apart.
Darkness trails away
on a black old cart
shoots me again with
a poisnus dart

Sun goes down
in the old graveyard
darkness falls and I
let down my guard.
The door slams shut
in the mentalward
the cuts heal late
for life I'm scarred
