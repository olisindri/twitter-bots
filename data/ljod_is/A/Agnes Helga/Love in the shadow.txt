Love in the shadow

I'm in the shadow,
I'm in the wind.
Wishpering in your ear,
I love you, I love you
so much, but please
don't leave me alone.
In the dark.

I'm still standing here,
Alone in the dark.
Alone watching
how beautiful you are.
Wondering, why can't you see me?
Why can't you love only me?

I'm in your dreams,
but you can't see me
because I'm in the wind,
I'm in the shadow.
Wishpering I love you.
