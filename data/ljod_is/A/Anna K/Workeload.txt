Workeload

When your mind starts to cloud
and fog settles in
When the voices you hear 
stop making sense
When the ache in your head
starts to scream through your ears
When the strength that you have 
is replaced by fatigue
When the burden you bear 
starts to bear you down

It\'s time to stop and go home
to a warm comfy bed
I\'ll even throw in a cuddle or two
