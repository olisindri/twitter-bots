A story about all the sensitivity in the world.
A story about that every human being has feelings, but somebody hide them as deep in their heart as they can, but all the others show their feelings to the world, their friends and everybody they care about.
A story about everything in the nature that is living, is having feelings, ewen the plants.
Every animal has a lot of sensitivity.
It\'s wonderful when the world share a big secret with you.
It\'s lovely to smell the flowers, the ocean and everything in the world.
It\'s wonderful to know that the world is looking after you, it cares for you, what you are and what you will be.
