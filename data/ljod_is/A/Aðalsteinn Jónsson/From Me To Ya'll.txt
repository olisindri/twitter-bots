From Me To Ya'll

I want to say few things to you all
To everybody who wants to see me fall
To everyone who hates me…

I don’t care, bring on the word
Do you think they really hurt?
I’ve heard them to many times before
I don’t care no more
Nothing to lose and nothing to live for
Pointless life and might as well end
No one to love and nobody to defend
I’m useless, at least I admit it
At least I got the balls to say fuck it
At least my words are real
Fuck this life if I can’t feel

No one wants me, I’m on my own
My mind starts tripping and I’m living in a dead zone
I got no home
No place to stay
Today is a perfect day
To die...
