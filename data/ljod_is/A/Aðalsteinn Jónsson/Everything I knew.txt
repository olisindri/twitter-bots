Everything I knew

Everything I once knew, is now lost
I don\'t know how long I\'ll be paying the cost
After all the pain that I\'ve caused
I\'m tired of everything that puts me down
Tired of people pushing me around
And tired of not knowing myself
Everything started with good cards in my hands
But now I have to pick out who to call my friends
I watch everything going wrong
I guess I\'m the idiot that drags along
