Unknown Faces

This world is full of sadness and dirt
Everywhere is hate and words that hurt
Will I ever find peace, will I ever find kindness
How will I find that in a world filled with blindness

I'm so tired of being mocked
Getting sick of the world that is fucked
No more love in these unknown places
Disappearing faces
Everyone I knew got away
I wish I'll never live again that day

Once I was in love with a girl
I gave her access to my world
But she took my trust and made me crawl
She took my emotional wall and made it fall
I gave her my soul so she could have it all

Now I can't get her out of my mind
Her attacks hurt me so deep I can't leave them behind
My heart is empty, she took all I had
I should never listen to what she said
It didn't mean shit, empty words
Words, that I won't take, but inside it hurts

All the pain I feel, I blame you
My heart has stopped from the bullet that went through
No more blood filled with sorrows in my vein
Now I'm just an memory in people's brain
