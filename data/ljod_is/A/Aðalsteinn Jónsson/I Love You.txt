I Love You

In my head is a picture
Sunshine and blue sky and I smile a little
Beautiful dream with you in the middle
I love you so much
I start shaking because of your touch
All your beauty in all it’s image
So much perfect ness with no limit
Kept in my heart and will never be forgotten

I love you, I really do
I don’t think I could live without you
Already I miss your laugh and your smile
Just thinking of that makes me forget everything else for a while
I live in a dream, it must be
Why else should girl like you want a man like me?

Whatever you do, don’t forget my name
Maybe I and all the others are all the same
But I can say I love you with no shame
Baby girl, I love you
Thanks for all the nice thing you said about me too
I’ve been in difficult times but you helped me through
Thanks for all the love you gave me
Thanks for showing me who I really be
Thanks for having love for me…..
