Raindrops 2

Raindrops on my face
Carrying me to a better place
The streets are gone, every pain washed away
I was standing alone, that rainy day
I have done something that I regret
Something in the raindrops won\'t let me forget
Who am I, what is this?
One love, one kiss
You are the only one I truly miss
Raindrops in my eye\'s when I watch you fade away
I know I won\'t get you back, but I pray
