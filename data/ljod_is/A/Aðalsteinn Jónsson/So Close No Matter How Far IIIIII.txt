So Close No Matter How Far IIIIII

I saw you in my dreams..
I saw you last night and it seems
I\'m in love with you still
My heart is empty and only you can fill
Can you hear my suffered cry
Can you see how slowly I die

I still can\'t believe it was you
My heart was beating on my chest and i thought it was coming through
You saw me, but did you care
Or have you forgot, life ain\'t fair
I still get lost in your eye\'s
Holding on to a memory that never dies...
