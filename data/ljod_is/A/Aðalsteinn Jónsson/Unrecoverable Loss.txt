Unrecoverable Loss

Do you know how it is to miss someone you care for?
At the last minute you look in their eyes and see things you never seen before
After all the time you spent with them is about to fade
And you wish it could be you instead, would you trade?
Strange feeling in your heart telling you it's about to end
Your loosing the one you've spended all your life trying to defend
Have you ever hold their hand while they are dying from you
You try to bring them to life but there's nothing you can do
Tears in your eyes, your getting scared, you feel alone
Suddenly the streets seems lonely, your car and your home
Nothing is same and it's bringing you down
To not having your loveones around
Unrecoverable loss in your heart
Now, when you and the one you loved, will always be apart
