Picture In The Mirror

Every time I look in the mirror I see you
But the image is fake and your face is too
I dream about you every night
I wish every day I could have you by my side
But, where did you go, I feel the lonelyness come over me
Why can't you stay with me like it's suppose to be?
I love you so badly, my heart doesn't pump anymore
Can't say it did ever before
Say I love you, I love you even more
Don't judge me though I'm poor
And if I make mistake don't push me out the door
I can't do everything but I try
I wanna give you my love till I die
When I see your face I get so high
Why do I love you, don't ask me why
I just wanna die by your side
And feel myself go farther and farther from the light....
