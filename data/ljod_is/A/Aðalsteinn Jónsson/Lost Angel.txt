Lost Angel

Why does it have to be this way?
I’ve lost my angel today
Why doesn’t anybody listen to what I got to say?
I’ve lost my angel away

I’ve been trying to tell you why
Only for you, I will die
You are my breath
Without you, I have only death

You are my eyes, without you I’m blind
Empty mind
Looking for something I’ll never find
Memories I left behind

My angel is gone
I don’t know what is going on
Who killed my angel?
Someone’s going to pay for this
