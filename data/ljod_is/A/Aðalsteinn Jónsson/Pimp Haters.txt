Pimp Haters

This poem is dedicated to all who think I suck
For everyone who thinks I should jump from a block
For everyone who thinks I’m a crack head
For every fucking bitch who thinks I’m good as dead

I’m tired of all this emotional violence
Tired of never getting any peace and silence
Can’t go out without some bullshit going on
Tired of hearing”where did you get that money from?”
It’s like I can’t do anything on my own
It’s like I don’t have a home
I love my family, but stop it
Stop asking me some questions, just drop it
I know I’m wasted
But I’m still the biggest pimp you ever tasted

I love my crib the most
I’m still representing the west side coast
I love you my friend and I got your back
So if anybody steps up to me, there’s no way back
Don’t judge me before you know me
No telling how far I’ll go
Nothing I can do, my brain just goes with the flow
It was in high school when my anger started to grow
Now I can’t do this anymore
My life isn’t like it was before
One day you open the door and see me still hanging in the ceiling
It’s not like anybody cares about my feeling

You know what? This is kind of funny
Chances of anybody reading this are the same like if I get any money
Nobody cares, nobody reads about my shit
Don’t tempt me to kill myself; I might as well do it
I hate everybody that barks at me
I hate everybody that won’t let me be
Pimp haters, all around
I can’t even go to town
Pimp haters are making me feeling down
One last word
My name will always be the biggest name you’ve heard
