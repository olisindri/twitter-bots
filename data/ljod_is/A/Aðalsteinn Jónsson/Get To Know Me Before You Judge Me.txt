Get To Know Me Before You Judge Me

(Intro:)
This is for all you people that think I'll never amount to shit....
(Verse 1)
Daddy, go ahead, call me P.I.M.P
I don't give a fuck, you obviously don't know me
And mom, say again I'll never make some G
Ya'll make me stronger by calling me a looser
But in the end, who's the real loser?
Get to know me before you judge me
And in the end, ya'll get to see
I ain't no fucking wimp
I've made it better than ya'll and I'm a pimp
I got the G, I got the ho's, I got the twenty fo's
My name is pimp, my shame ain't real
I'm going to make ya'll enter my mind to feel
How close I'm to kill (kill my enemy's)
I can do everything, I'm da p.i.m.p with tha Gz

(chorus:)
Fuck all you that doubt me
Burn in hell for cursing the P.I.M.P
But in the end y'all see
That I'm tha dogg with da G

(Verse 2:)
Yeah, my parents don't know shit
I'm gone now and I won't return until I've made it
This song is especially dedicated to you
All you did was calling me a failure and a fool
So what, maybe I'm a failure but I don't give a fuck
I don't care about others opinion, if ya'll don't like me, suck my cock
Go ahead, kick me out, make me glad
Because if I'll stay with ya'll any longer, I'm good as dead
But when I think about it, I'm on my own
I don't know what to call the place that used to be my home
Fuck, I hate people that call them selfs friend
And when I need help they just slam on my hand
Fuck all people that doesn't help others in must
So for real, who can you really trust

(chorus:)
Fuck all you that doubt me
Burn in hell for cursing the P.I.M.P
But in the end y'all see
That I'm tha dogg with da G

(Verse 3:)
Only way to glad my dad
Is if he would see me on the floor dead
Be careful what you wish for
Because that dream can get more
I could just kill myself like I tould you before
It seems like you don't care
You just think I wouldn't dare
But what will you say when your dream will come true
What will you say, what will you do
Maybe: "I hated that nigga" and my mom say's: "Yeah, I hated that fool too"
One love, and my parents ain't in it
Fuck Y'all that said I would never amount to shit.
