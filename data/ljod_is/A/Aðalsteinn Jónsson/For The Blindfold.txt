For The Blindfold

As the world turns around, and I\'m holding down
All the hate that I care for this earth
My mind filled with sorrow since my birth
All I see is people stabing me with my own knife
Everybody hates me, but I hate my life
Is that what you all need, kill myself indeed
My eyes are open, but still so blind
Feeling hate that was once so kind
Once I\'m lost, once I\'m dead
You should think about what I said
