Apocolypse

Light my life, light my fire
light up my dreams and my desire
put down my hopes but never leave me alone
I just can't think now when your gone
Must have your love, now when apocolypse is on
My fire in your chest has faded away
and now it seems it doesn't matter what I say
And the time I wished never to come, is today
Apocolypse, in my heart, in my dreams
my feelings are dead and my mind screams
It's now, end of time is near
in every heart, filled with fear
We're dead, apocolypse is here!
