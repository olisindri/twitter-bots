It Happened Again

You thought I only wanted us to be friends
Why did it have to happen again?
I thought this was it
Something perfect I’ve always wanted
This was just too good for my simple mind
You are the girl I’ve always wanted to find
But now I have to go, leaving you behind
I keep ask myself; will there be more
I think I’ve never been so in love like this before
I wish you could understand how I feel
If you only knew my feelings are real
Would it even matter?
You knowing my mind, would it be better?
I’m taking a walk in the rain
Hoping it will wash away my pain
But my feelings for you are too strong
Maybe trying to let them go is wrong
After all, I want to have a picture on your face
Kept in my heart in a warm place
You thought I only wanted us to be friends
Why did it have to happen again?
