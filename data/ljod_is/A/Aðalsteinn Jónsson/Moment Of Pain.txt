Moment Of Pain

Did I hurt again, I keep thinking
Am I on my way to hell, in my own pain sinking
I'm stuck in moment of pain
Hell used to come over me, but now with rain
No silent in my chest, voices making me hear
That my life, will end right here

Maybe I deserve being in pain
I've been to long driving on the wrong lane
But I've never done things I should die for
Maybe I should go to hell and never show myself anymore
Doing people a favour, leave without a trace
Stay for eternity in a cold lonely place

I've said I'm sorry, but it can't replace the things I took
I can't do anything to make it up, but look
If I could die instead, I would do
I feel so bad and I'm so sorry for you
Now I go to claim my place in hell
I'm sorry for everything I couldn't tell
Moment of pain, memory I should erase
Memory of you touching my face
Moment of love, only thing I ever had
But now...I'll die alone...and sad
