Tired

Oh my.....
I'm so tired being right
I'm tired being alone every night
When I shouldn't be on my own
But my dream has left me alone
She did wrong, she made a bad mistake
But he took the dream I was ment to take

Jealousy soul and a failure man
Why is it so hard to see I'm your greatest fan
You are doing the same mistake twice
Why can't you follow the angel's advice
What is it your really want from me
I'm not gonna spend anymore time trying to make you see
When you seem to be blind
What is going on in your complicated mind
All I got left is letting go of my breath
Because nothing is out there for me but death
