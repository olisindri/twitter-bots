Options

Lonelyness, failure and sad
these are the options I ever had
I'm a left over, useless punk
I'm what they call "white junk"
no good for anyone
Nobody see's me anymore
but it's not like they did it before
I've got nothing to live for
I must kill myself as soon as I can
so my body can be put in a trashcan
These are the options I have.....
