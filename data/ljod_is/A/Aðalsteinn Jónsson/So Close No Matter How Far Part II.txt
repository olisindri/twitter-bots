So Close No Matter How Far Part II

One thing I just found out
I do not want what I’m dreaming about
My thoughts have played me bad
My mind has played me mad
My weakness has played me dead

Only love I had, is done
Only dream I had, is gone
I woke up
Realized my life is fucked
Empty like it was always meant to be
And the dark and the pain will stay with me

I’m sorry for every tear that I’ve caused
I’m sorry for every memory I lost
I’m sorry for I can’t see
I’m sorry, but my dream will die with me

Even if I die, would it matter?
If I stay alive, why would it make it better?
What have I done to myself?

I’ve taken my last breath
I’m waiting for my own death
