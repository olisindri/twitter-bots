Dear Friend

Dear friend, I just wanted to let you know
Whatever happens I will never let you go
You stood by my side when ever I felt down
You were the one risking your life when I was about to drown
I just want you to know that for you I'll always be around
Dear friend, when I was close to death, you're the one I found

Where ever you might go, whatever you might do
In my heart I'll always keep a picture of you
My friend, I can't explain in words how I feel
You've been there for me like friend for real
What can I give in return

Dear friend, never go away
I need you more every passing day
Whatever you do and whatever you say
Someday, for your kindness I'll pay
Dear friend, everyday for you I pray
