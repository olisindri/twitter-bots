Pray To God

Now I lay myself down to sleep
I ask to God, his promise to keep
And if I won’t get what I want when I wake
I pray to God, my dreams to take

She said she loved me, I knew she could lie
Maybe I hoped for something else, I don’t know why
But in your arms I want to die
Why can’t I find what I’m looking for?
Not sure this has ever happened before
I got what I wanted, but I want more
I thought you could understand, but you don’t
You thought I would give up, but I won’t

I pray for what I want so much
Pray for another opportunity to touch….
Pray for you, because I care
I can always find the good smell of your hair
What can I say? I just love you
And my pray to you is, that one do you’ll do to
