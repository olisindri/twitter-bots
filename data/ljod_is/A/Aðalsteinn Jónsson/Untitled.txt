As I woke up, and the sun rise once again
As my eye\'s, filled with sand
Blind by the crowd
Nobody understands what I\'m talking about
My eye\'s were dry, but now ear run\'s out
I took a walk down the street
If i would fall, would anybody help me back on my feet?
I got home, and I took a bath
And I cut myself to release the wrath
I still felt down, so I cut my neck
The water got red, and I couldn\'t take it back
I knew it was to late
Only thing I could do was wait
As I lost my final breath
People were waiting for my death
All the sudden everybody were around
They took me up and I saw the love that I\'ve found
