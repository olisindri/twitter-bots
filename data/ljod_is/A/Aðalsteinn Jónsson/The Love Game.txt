The Love Game

You say it can\'t be the same
After all the time I\'ve been playing this game
You say it can\'t be as it was
You tell me it\'s time for me to get lost
I love you whatever you do
I\'ve travelled a long road and what do I get
Nothing but feeling upset
Why did I bother
I tried to escape the lost but instead I got another
Should I stay or should I leave
That decision is pulling on my sleeve......

Should I disappear, should I?
