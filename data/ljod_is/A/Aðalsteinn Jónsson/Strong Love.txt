Strong Love

I love your smell, your face and your eyes
But everything is hidden beneath your lies
I’ve made my mistakes and I’m forced to pay
I can hear your voice in my head every day
I’ve been in suffer for too long now
It will all go away but I keep asking me how

I’ve spend so much time in loneliness
Waiting to find a true happiness
But I let my true love get away
