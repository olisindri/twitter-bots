Imagine

Imagine there\'s no love,
It\'s hard to believe,
No one stand befront us,
Above us only sky,
Imagine all the love
I\'m giving you today...

Imagine there\'s no me and you,
It is hard to do,
Nothing to love or die for,
No religion too,
Imagine all the love
and life we can have in peace...

You may say Im a dreamer,
and you are the only one,
I hope some day you\'ll love me,
And we will live as one.

Imagine no love,
I wonder if you can,
No need for pain or suffer,
but you love another man,
Imagine all the love
Sharing everything I had...

You may say Im a dreamer,
but Im not the only one,
I hope some day you\'ll love me,
And you and me will live as one.
