Shadows Of The Past

Every where I look, everytime I sleep
I am afraid I have fallen too deep
I run in the dark, I hide behind my lies
I dream of your silver gifted eyes
As I look up at the sky
My body tempature falls
Every word I\'ve spoken are false
But I can\'t tell, I can\'t say
Because your hate killed me today...
