Typical Love Story

It started as a love at first sight
I'll always remember your beautiful face
But then it ended with a constant fight
And eventually with a murder case

My love to you was too strong
I couldn't take the pain
You didn't love me all along
And the thought of that, makes me go insane

It's not fair, to make one man pay
You hurt me so deep
I just wish you could come to me and stay
So we can together, lay down to sleep
