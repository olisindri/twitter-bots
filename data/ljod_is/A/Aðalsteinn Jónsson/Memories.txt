Memories

I have pictures in my mind
Walking away leaving you behind
My eyes are fading, my skin is turning none
When I turn around, you’re gone
Sometimes I feel empty and I don’t know why
Memories of you will never die…

I miss you so much, but I left you alone
I’ve tried to contact you but no one answers the phone
Please come back to me, I can’t breath
I feel this pain calling me deep beneath
Can’t live without you….
Don’t know what to do…
I don’t know if I can live this through….
I beg you; I will do anything to be yours again
I had my chance, but I ran….
