God Made Mistake

God made a big mistake
He sends me to this world for me to take
Every pain in every heart
Instead my own, has fallen apart
What do I get instead?
Only wishful thinking I was dead
My feelings are wrecked
My heart is whacked
I can’t even think on my own…

What has happened to these perfect friends?
Our friendship has faded and soon it ends
Why? I scream in the rain
On my both knees knocking my head in the ground trying to blow my brain
I see my blood in a pistol smoke
I stop breathing and about to choke
I hear people around celebrating my death
I knew everybody hated me….

I’ve made my friends become numb
They’re fading away; I wish I could do some
I hate who I am, I hate what I’m going to become
I’m just counting down to the minute I kill myself
I don’t care anymore on my behalf
This might be my last poem, I really don’t mind
Another idiot like me is easy too find
I’m just another freak who was left behind
How could I be this stupid, I was blind?
But now my eyes have opened so I can finally see
All the bullshit people are talking about me
Fuck everybody who hates me
Fuck everybody who thinks I can’t amount to shit
Tell me to kill myself, fuck; I might as well do it
When you read this, maybe I’m dead, maybe I’m not
Like who gives a fuck so, so what?
Like Manson said:
This was never my world
U took my angel away
I’ll kill myself to make everybody pay…..
