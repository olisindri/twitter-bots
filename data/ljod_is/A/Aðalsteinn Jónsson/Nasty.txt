Nasty

I smell like a lollipop/nasty ass dogg and I like to fuck/my daughter is on my cock/I feel so much pain that I\'m about to give up/I feel all this pain growing in my head/help me on my feet so I can get back in my bed/my face is fucked and is turning red/I can\'t think straight cause my brain is dead/I think I\'m sick/maybe it\'s just an national trick/bad dream controlled by some chick/my head is about to explode/I won\'t be fine till I get back on tha road/with heavy load/of cd\'s with J-Lo/and don\'t tell me to lay low/I\'m an nasty ass monster

I got my closet full of clothes that I won\'t wear/I\'m so crazy that my momma had to send me to a foster care/and when I got my first pumice hair/I ran away from home/fuck cunts and had my eye\'s pierced/drank liquor till my brain began to disappear/I\'m that man whom yo momma told ya\'ll to fear/you should run away everytime I\'m near

I used to smoke grass/I probably end this shit by blowing up my ass/I\'m just gonna finish this one and I must be fast/An police officer is in the place/I hit him in his face and I got his blood on my face/I ran out and i got no trace/but I ran back in and shot the officer in the head just in case/went out and raped the next bitch that I saw/another officer came and shouted that I couldn\'t fuck with the law/so I shot his ass away/and that\'s what happens to everybody that are in my way/but when I was little I was a super high timid/but now I\'m a nasty ass with no limit/and I don\'t wanna lick your cunt, I wanna be in it

Fuck this/fuck that/give me another pot/I just wanna lie on the couch and smoke alot/my momma told me to quit smoking crack/I turned around and cut her neck/Oh shit what have I done/I knew there was no time to run/my eye\'s started to bleed/what can I do, I\'ve smoked to much weed/gotta get a grip, fuck/my brain beat has dropped/I must be dead/I\'m on upper level/I felt right down to the devil/I was locked in a cell/Oh shit, this must be hell
