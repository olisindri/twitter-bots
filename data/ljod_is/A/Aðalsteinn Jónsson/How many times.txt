How many times

How many times do I fail
How many times will I be in jail
How many times will I hurt myself
How many times will I be between heaven and hell
How many times will I be stranded in life
How many times will I look at the knife
and how many times will I cut my wife
How many times will I say it's the last
How many times will I curse the past
How many times do I need your eyes
How many times will I tell u lies
How many times will I end this shit
How many times have I said, that I mean it
