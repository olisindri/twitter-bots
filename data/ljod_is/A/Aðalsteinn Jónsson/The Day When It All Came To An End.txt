The Day When It All Came To An End

The past is gone, and the future is here
Alone, shaking and full of fear
The day I lost my friend
It was the day when it all came to an end

In the shadows of my own dept
Holding and emptiness that I kept
The day I lost my friend
It was the day when it all came to an end

Loved by the hatred
Hated by those I penetrated
The day I lost my friend
It was the day when it all came to an end
