Story

Oh man, I did it again!
Here's my story....

I met a girl and made a mistake
I knew I was doing wrong
But that's the way I choose to take
And you didn't love me all along

This mistake I repeated to take
I kept falling into the same trap
My soul was starting to shake
You say you love me, but I won't listen to that crap

Have you ever loved without being loved right back
Then you know how I feel
When your world starts to fade to black
And nothing feels real

I've been there five times and I hate it
You say you like me
But it doesn't mean shit
You are just an ordinary ho who I don't like to see

Only change of think
Is in my car
With a cuban and a drink
But that dream is so far

I want someone to comfort me
Don't try to change my mind
Who do you want me to be
Cause myself is hard to find
