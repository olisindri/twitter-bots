Nice Duck

Difference between nice ducks and me is none
Them and me thinks water is fun
Maybe that ducks are covered in feather
But my ass is dressed up in leather
But we are brothers whatever
And we’ll be niggaz forever
Some people look down on ducks but they’re clever
They can send duck’s terrorist in USA
Bomb that mothafucka far away (wawawawa)
They’ll do it to you if you won’t listen to what they got to say
And when that happen you can’t hide behind eBay
You fucking Internet gay
Stop hiding and come out to the light
Get ready to receive in e-mail huge Internet fight
I can battle you and you know it
Cause when I release the ducks you ain’t shit
They’ll attack you to the ground and you’ll be crippled
What do you say now when they’re biting in your nipple? (Aaaaa)
To late now bitch, they won’t leave
Cause these mothafuckas are pulling in your sleeve
And they won’t stop till’ your dead
They’ll eat up everything that is in your head

This is a nice duck
Drunken one and likes to fuck
She got no cock
But still she fucks everyone on the block

Really nice duck lives straight on the underground
You can search but she won’t be found
Cuz she don’t wants to have people around
She’ll snap and follow you like a bloodhound
She’ll bite off your dick without making a sound
Cuz these feathered mothafuckas don’t show weakness
That’s cuz they don’t have one, so they don’t take shit
They won’t have it, if you try, you’ll only make them the worst
Cuz these cocksuckas must be full of evilness and they’re cist
They’ll kill you and you’ll be the first
Then they’ll take over the universe
They’re dangerous and they bite
We must get ready for a duck fight
Maybe we lose but we must see the light in sight shining bright
Soon they’ll attack, then there’s no way back, there will be a lot of whack
And the government is sitting on they’re ass smoking crack
And they can’t see how the future will be black
It’s over, but I can’t cry, 
I’ll rather wait in the darkness and slowly die
So let’s be nice to each other, even ducks, they can battle to
Don’t forget, or they might look up for you.
