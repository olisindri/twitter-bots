Emotional Violence

I'm sitting in silence
Thinking about putting an end to this
I'm dealing with emotional violence
I don't even know how happiness truly is

I got the blade in my hand and ready to cut
I want to live, but my life is fucked
What will be able to stop this pain
My desire to live, is about to drain

Each day I think about how to put an end to my life
And now I'm sitting on my bed with a knife
Waiting after the right moment to stab
One opportunity, I won't hesitate to grab
