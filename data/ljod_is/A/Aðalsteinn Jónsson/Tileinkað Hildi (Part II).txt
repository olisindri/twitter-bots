Tileinkað Hildi (Part II)

The sun is rising; my eyes are filled with light
I walk to my window and outside is a beautiful sight
I get my clothes and step outside
Morning sun is shining bright
Tears in my eyes so I dry them clean
This day is beautiful and filled with hope and everything between
I’m walking on green grass and I’m breathing a fresh air
I hear the birds singing and the wind blowing in my hair
The sun has gone down, and I’m in my bed
Finally my tears has stopped to fled
I’m looking forward to see what tomorrow has for me
So many things I have to try and see
Now I say good night
When I reach to the lamp to turn off the light
