Enough

There are no words to describe how I feel
I just wish these dreams would become real
So tired thinking that all it seem
Will always stay in my dream

I just think I might not last the day
It’s wrong but I believe it anyway
Everything has been said that need to say
I’ll just turn back to my life and walk my own way
