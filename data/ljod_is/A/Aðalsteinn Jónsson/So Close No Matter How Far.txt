So Close No Matter How Far

Ah man, I’m looking in her eyes
I think I could die, twice
I think I’m going to give myself some advice
Before I find out
I’m not going to get what I’m dreaming about
All my thoughts are fake
Every time I look at her, my inside starts to shake
First time I saw her I started to melt
There are no words to describe how I felt
All the sudden my loneliness went away
I wish I could feel this every day

But on second thought, I thought again
We can’t be anything than just a friend
I dreamed wrong
Could have told myself all along
Too good to be true
Should have knew
I would never get someone like you
I filled my mind with lies
I just feel so perfect when I look into your eyes

But I won’t get you
Too many obstacles that I need to get through
I think you’re just so perfect for me too
The worst part is, there’s nothing I can do….

Again I start to think
My feelings are going to sink
So much pressure to take
Once again my mind to you is fake
Once again my inside has started to shake
The reason is clear
I feel helpless when you are near
Please touch me so I can feel safe
Because when I’m with you I don’t know how to behave

My feelings to you are still strong
I thought I could have you, I was wrong
Like before, my mind is filled with lies
But I still fly away when I look into your eyes
Every day I scream for guide
What will I need to do to have you by my side



Are my thoughts right
Will we ever unite?
For you I will burn my heart
Oh God, never do us apart
I beg to heaven to make us one
I’m in a competition with God, and he won
I refuse to loose you
And no matter what you do
Don’t go away
Please don’t ignore what I say
I must confess for everybody here today
I love you more each passing day
These confessions could make people hurt
I’ll take my chances to be left alone in the dirt

I don’t care what other people say
I don’t care because of this I might get killed one day
I taste the air to make sure it’s real
I touch the air to make sure I can feel
But I know it’s true
I’m still so in love with you

Maybe you deserve more than I can give from me
Maybe I’m blind, maybe I can’t see
But my feelings are still to strong to break
My inside still starts to shake
Your loving is to strong to take

I’ve made the decision about you
Killing these dreams is what I’m going to do...
