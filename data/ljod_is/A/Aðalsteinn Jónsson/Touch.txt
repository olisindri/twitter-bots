Touch

When you put your hands upon my face
I almost disappear to another place
Your touch is like being swept away
and I feel like loving you is the right way

You caused me to start believing in me
Us together, was always ment to be
Whatever might happen, I'm there for you
Love me girl, and I'll love you too
