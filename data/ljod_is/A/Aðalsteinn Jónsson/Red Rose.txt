Red Rose

If you only knew how important you are to me
if there were some way to let you see
that with me, is the safest place to be
in my arms, in my heart, in my dreams
I love you so bad but it seems
that the only place you won't be do any harm
is when I hold you in my arm
there is a red rose in my mind
big red rose with big shadow behind
the shadow is my life and the rose is you
and the entire beauty about it too
