Nowhere to go

The rain has fallen upon my dreams.....
The tragedy hunts me for what I am….
But I ask myself….what am I?.....

I’m walking alone in the dark, the rain has taken my hopes away
Every tear I’ve made has been washed today
I’m trying to tell myself this is not how it ends
Am I alive or dead?....It depends….
I see the rain falling on the street, the lights are out
I just don’t understand what this life is about
I miss you, I really do, but you left me in the rain….
The only memory of you is my pain

I pray everyday for the rain to stop, is there hope?
I’m running in the dark, slipped on a bag of rope
My face is wet, the rain got me, I feel no hurt…
In the cold dark comes a man with bright light pulling me off the dirt
I felt so cold, but I knew it was warm
This man had my life in his arm
I looked into his eyes, I saw my future….I saw my death
The man suddenly disappeared and I lost my breath
I felt down on my knees, I didn’t feel so good
I saw…I’m not sure but then I finally understood
The rain went away like my dreams….
The tragedy hunts me for what I am….
But then I thought, you are the one
But in my heart you were gone
I need you….but you don’t want me back, am I told
I looked up to the sky, I felt so much cold
And when I closed my eyes….I didn’t want to open them
And I will never do it again…

I asked God to take me, let me into your door
My heart stopped beating, and won’t beat anymore…..
They buried me in the dark..in the cold
It was not true what they told
You loved me, after all I said…
I wish now, I wasn’t dead
You’re on my grave beating the dirt
God I wish I could be heard
You lay down and cry…your tears changed into hurt
Your love woke me up…I tried to breath..
I just couldn’t  escape from the beneath
You didn’t even hear me…I screamed, I cried
You will never forget the day that I died…..
