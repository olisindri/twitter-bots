I'm trying to show you how I feel by writing this letter
Because I can't find any way to describe it better
Every time I felt down
I knew you would always be around
For my comfort, for my pain
We got a friendship I would like to maintain
I got something in my hands I will never let go
Caring between you and me I would like to grow

No matter what you’ve done, no matter what you say
I will always love you more each passing day
If you feel bad you can always come too me
I will make you happy and let you see
That you can become everything you ever wanted to be
I support all the things you will do
Just remember when I say
I will always love you….
