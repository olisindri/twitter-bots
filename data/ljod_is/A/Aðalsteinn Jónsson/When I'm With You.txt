When I'm With You

I think your special, I think your great
When I'm with you, I don't know hate
You must be an angel, you bright up my day
Doesn't matter if it's night, your beauty brights it up anyway
My words are real
I'm only telling you how I feel
How many nights did I spend thinking about you
Come to think about it, that's the only thing I wanna do
You were everywhere, in my dreams, in my mind
You're the only feeling I couldn't leave behind
That's a good thing, I never wanna lose you
I wish you think the same thing about me too
If you would ask.....the answer would be, I DO!
