Back In The Days

I remember those times when I enjoyed excist
The angels don't want me to die but I must insist
There are so many things in this world making me pissed
I hate people for not having faith in me
So much anger for those who cannot see
In the end I will rise and make it to the top
My ambition is strong and will never stop
I have a goal in life and I'm gonna get it
And I hate people for not helping me shit
You have only made me strong
Ya'll think I've been a loser all along
Guess what, you're wrong
Good times ahead
I will ride on till the day I end up dead
Back in the days I was nothing
But the anger inside me made me feel like I was something
Your disappointment has only made my balls grow bigger
For thinking I'll never make it in the music has made me turn into a nigger
So much dark thoughts inside my mind
Positive sides are rarely to find
Cuz everything reminds me on back in the days I left behind
