Cold Hearted

In my blood, in my vein
Is a poison that is toxicing my brain
All motion are still, my system doesn't respond
My memory has been forgotten....

Have you ever felt so in love that you could die
So in love that she makes you feel high
Ever got so lost in the beauty of her eye's
That makes you think there's nothing you wouldn't sacrifice
For only one moment in her sight
Keep thinking if she see's me tonight
Can't tell wrong from right
My dreams are gone, I let them go without a fight
Long ago I got away from the light
Living in the dark shadow of my own
And the devil that took my soul and my home
