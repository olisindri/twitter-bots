Angel

It’s in your eyes….
I cannot describe it….
Something beautiful has caught my eye
I felt my heart beat deeper when you walked by
Unknown feeling I never felt before
You make me think life is worth living for
I’ve never talked to you, but your beauty said all what’s need to say
I’ll always remember the day you walked across my way
You left without a word
I scream after you but it won’t be heard
You must be an angel, your shining face has it all
Falling in love with you, will probably be my fall
