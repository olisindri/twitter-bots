So Close No Matter How Far Part IIIII

My hand is shaking, I\'m trying to write
Something\'s in my heart I have to make right
You\'ve been lost for six months, and I don\'t expect you to call
They say you\'re in drugs, but I don\'t want to believe it at all
But as horrible it may sound, it\'s true
And that\'s the reason why I lost you
If you could just been smarter and go my way
We might be still together this day...

I hate myself because of you, you make me sad
Alive or dead?
It\'s simple as that...
