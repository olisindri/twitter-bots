Let Me Love You

Please, let me love you girl
You are my reason for living in this world
You are the energy I need, to make it through
Only way for my to live, is with you
When I'm alone, I don't know what to do
Please come back to me and stay
Be with me and never go away
I need you in my arm
I will protect u against those who wanna do u harm
