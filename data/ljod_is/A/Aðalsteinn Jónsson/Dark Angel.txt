Dark Angel

Come close, and feel my breath
Kiss, upon her dream, and a silent death
On my dying body, my soul has faded away
Crying spirit, has left us today....

For my dark angel, I swept away from this earth
For all evil, she is having a birth
I\'m the son of an angel, the angel is mine
For dying hope, for it will never shine

As I open up my eyes, only shadow in my heart
Dark Angel of mine, why have you put death upon dart
As I look around, everything is cold
What have I done, this is my own fault....
