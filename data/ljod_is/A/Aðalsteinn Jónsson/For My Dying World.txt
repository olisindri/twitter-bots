For My Dying World

I\'m looking out the window, all the hate I see
Everybody\'s gathered to follow me
And I cry inside, I cry for every soul that lives
In this mad world no one forgives
People standing all around, angry and waiting for my death
I fight for every last needing breath
I stand alone, the world is on my shoulders.

My own bleeding arrow, my heart is betrayed and sorrow
If I close my eyes, will there be any tomorrow
As I fall down on a dying hand
Death for all people and dying land

All I see, is pain and hate
As they say, for everyone, already been decided fate
For my dying love, I shall rise up and take you away
As the hatred world, on their knees, and pray.
