My Girl

How can I explain my feelings?
How can you expect me to tell?
If you don’t know how I fell
And I’m baring all these thoughts by myself
And at the end I might snap and crash into pieces
What do you expect of me? I’m not a Jesus
I got a normal feelings, I’m human and not between two species
I can’t take everything on my soul and carry it like diseases
I must let it out and shout: why do I carry this birth?
It’s not I like this earth, and if I had one wish, I would wish the whole world reverse
And then I wouldn’t feel all this pain in my brain
And finally start living my life normal
I don’t need too keep me suit in formal
Cause I can wear anything I want and there’s nuttin you can do too stop it
By killing me maybe, try it and get fucked, Shit!
Hell, now I can even go in split
Without blowing my balls on the walls every time they falls

It’s my girl
My precise
In my world
She’s my freshness’ 

My girl is special to me and I’ll do anything to protect her
And if you treat her I’ll move too another sector
And if you follow us, I’m a kill you without affect her
Bury you in the backyard so she won’t be aware
Where I putted your white ass and where I hide the stash
Cause I love my girl, she’s special to me
Have you ever seen animals fight for their food?
Tenfold that and then you get how angry I can get
When somebody angers my pet and gets me on set to attack
Put me on my close level and transform me into a devil
And now it’s no way too run this battle
I’ll bury you in the ground and sit on you while smoking half a pound
And if you rise up asking for a second round
I’ll shit on you and shoot you with my shotgun
Cause I got weapons but you got none
So I can shot in your head for fun
And there’s no use to run
Cause when I got my goal and I’m on the roll
And there’s nuttin you can do other than fall
Just give up, you don’t gotta soul.
Nigga wit no trigga putting out my cigar
Ohh shits, no way nigga, get away from my face
You know I don’t want you in my place
Just get out of here without a trace
Or I’ll kill ya black ass fagot
Cause my brain is rigged and ready to blow
And it will happen if you put him on overload
I still don't give a fuck I'm still with your mommas face in my butt
I can blow your face in the space with no trace
And don’t use the “F” word
Fuck, you didn’t heard
I’m not that kind of guy who likes too being flirt
And if you try too talk I’ll fuck you in the ass so you won’t be able too walk
