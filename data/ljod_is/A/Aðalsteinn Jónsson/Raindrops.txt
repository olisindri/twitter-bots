Raindrops

Raindrops in my face as I watch you fade away
I know I won't get you back, but I pray
The pain has a mirror and is pointing at me
Probably beause I've been blind and is trying to make me see
That you and I were never ment to be

Alone standing in the rain
My heart is filled with lonelyness and pain
All my dreams has suddenly become my nightmare
Every night waking up looking for someone that isn't there
Thougtless mind with painful emptyness

Waking up, alone
Thinking that now I'm on my own
I whisper in the dark every night
Will the angels show me the light
My path in life has faded
I've been through hell but I made it

Your face behind the raindrops tears my skin
I can't let out the pain within
The fallen angel is laughing at me too
But in the raindrops, will always be a picture of you
