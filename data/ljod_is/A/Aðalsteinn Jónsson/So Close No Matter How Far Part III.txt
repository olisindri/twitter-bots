So Close No Matter How Far Part III

I knew this day would come
You say you still love me, where are these words from?
But when I looked into your eyes, there was something that made me think
I’ve failed to make my feelings to you sink
I’m mad about you, I love you so much
I love your every smile, every touch
Everything I had, isn’t mine anymore
Recognized this feeling from before
I felt so lonely when I walked away from you through the door
I saw emptiness ahead
Circle of dead
Spinning around in my mind
So fast, how could I be so blind?
It is all coming to me now, finally I know
Now I’m sure why you didn’t say no
I know why you said all these pretty things about me
I prayed to God to let me keep you, he didn’t agree
Everything I’ve worked for, everything I’ve said
Just wish all my feelings to you could be dead

Do you even have any idea how it is
Ever tried to feel like this?
Ever tried to scream for something that won’t answer?
Someone up there has left you, doesn’t it hurt
Feeling like you’ve been left in the dirt!
It sucks, doesn’t it? Let me know
And the pain will only continue to grow…..grow…
