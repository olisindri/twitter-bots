Unnur Bett√Ω

How could this happen? Now you\'re gone
What can I say..

I heard the news, you have left this earth
Why shall it always be death instead of birth
You were a good friend, and I will never forget
The place, night, and the time that we met
I have been trying to face my sorrow
But for you my dear, ain\'t no tomorrow
Why did you go, why did you leave...
