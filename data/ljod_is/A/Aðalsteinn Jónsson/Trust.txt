Trust

One chance, one word to make it right
Stop the violence and drop the fight
Is there a peace in sight?
One day with silent fire
Burning everything that was your desire
One moment is all it takes
To do unforgivably mistakes
Something stupid causing that your friendship brakes
True friend, someone to depend on
Will he stand by your side or will he be gone
Who can you trust?
Who will make your heart crushed?
Someone you can love without shame
Friend who understands your pain
Who keeps you in his frame
Someone that doesn’t run away from you….

One chance, one word to blow away
Everything that your friends used to say
Are they really your friends? Where are they today?
Standing beside you? No, it’s just the shadow of their broken promises….

To forgive is hard, to forget is the worst
Who will take their lives? Let me be the first
There’s nothing you can do to make this go away
I don’t want to be like everyone else, I choose my own way
Everybody thinks they need to do the same as the others
Follow in the path of their father’s or their mother’s
Be yourself, do what you want to do
Don’t let your friends stop you
Because they can hurt too
