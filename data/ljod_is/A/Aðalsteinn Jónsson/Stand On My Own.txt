Stand On My Own

All the time, I used to say
That eventually I would pass away
People didn't listen, but it's now today
Standing on my own
Lost everyone I love...all sleeping nights alone
In the dark, freak is leashed
They hate me, I'm a beast
Pain and pain over again
Nothing I do, can make me a man
I'm so sorry for the things I've done
I want to come out of the dark and see the sun
No more hiding, no more shame
Everywhere I go, it's all the same
People are all the devil, but with a different name
I want to die, I'm sick of playing this game...
