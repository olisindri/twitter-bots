Reborn

One, two, three and death takes over me
People telling me how to act and how to be
Heart filled with emptiness and sorrow
Every day I\'m in my own world worrying about tomorrow
It takes a miracle to change my mind
Devil himself in human form taking everything that was mine
One day, When everything has crossed it\'s line
My mind snaps, even tough my heart says I\'m fine
How can I trust something that is dead
What about my doctors advice, I don\'t give a fuck what he said
I\'m too caught up with death to bother taking another breath

Beneath my feets I dig my own grave
Trying to take me? I\'m already a slave
My words are real, but my plan is safe
Oh didn\'t i say?
I can\'t be killed, not now, I\'ll die another day
Reborn, In form of pain
Bring it to you raw like the rain
In me is only disaster and who to blame?
Everybody hate the picture including me in the frame
Well, I\'ve made some mistakes
But that what it takes
The worst is love, love I had
But...You can\'t love something that already is dead
I was made, but now life is through with me
is it fair? mind filled with pain ans insanity
Every morning I wake up and see the same thing
I\'m nothing, but in my mind I\'m the king
Gold, platinum and a diamond ring
And world wide death is what I bring...
