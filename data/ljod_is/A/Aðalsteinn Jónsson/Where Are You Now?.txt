Where Are You Now?

Where have you gone?

Wherever I look, none

You ran away when I was needing

Feeling alone, bitter and bleeding

Dying beneath your feets

I only hear my heart\'s final beats

Where is my breath?

I was waiting suffer and soon death

My hands, covered in blood

Now, where is my God?



My eye\'s were blind, but still I could see the sky

Where are you now, when I\'m dying...?
