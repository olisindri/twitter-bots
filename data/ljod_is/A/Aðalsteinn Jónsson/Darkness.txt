Darkness

Darkness all around me
My life's in shadow and nothing I see
My enemy has my dream, he took her today
He took my girl, and left me with only future gray
Something in my heart was taken away
I might never recover

I was left alone in the desert of pain
My hate, I can never explain
Heart, filled with hopes, all away it swept
Just one thing I kept
Memory of you in my grave
My home is now my cave
I'm a prison behind my own bars of steel
All the motion I used to feel
Are gone, you have brought death among
I guess I've taken it for too long
Now, I'll die in the fire of love
Burn in hell for you....
