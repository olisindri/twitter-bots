Outside

The cold is outside, but I feel warm
Because I know when I’m with you, nothing can do me harm
As the wind comes in, the smile went away from my face
I know I can be something if I get out of this place
I can’t feel my lips, my words can’t get out
I can’t say those things I’m thinking about
You take my hand and walk me on
But in the cold night you are gone
My breath is getting harder to take
These feelings are too hard too break
I keep tight my memories by the lake
Everything was perfect, the moon showed us the way
It was almost a perfect day....
Suddenly the clouds went gray
The cold was in me....
I couldn’t say.....
I felt down on my knees and dirt was in my eyes
I was so blind, I couldn’t see your lies
No more goodbyes….

I try to fly away, as my feets are getting stronger
I’m trying to find you so we can be together longer
I will never forget what you said
“I will never leave you” but you are dead
Something grabbed my leg and helt me close
I got lonely but then I saw this red rose
Something reminds of you, this rose is a sign
Even though you will never be mine
I always will have your face in my eyes
And a memory that never dies….
