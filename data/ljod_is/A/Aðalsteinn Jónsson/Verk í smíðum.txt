Verk í smíðum

The streets are empty like my heart when you left
Standing in the pooring rain with a picture of you that I kept
But you can\'t really see all the pain and the lies
I try not to look back and dry the raindrops from my eyes
I hear the wind whispering in my ear
He tells me that what I am looking for is not here
And no matter where I might go and whatever people may say, I don\'t care
From the bottom of my heart I know you will be there
