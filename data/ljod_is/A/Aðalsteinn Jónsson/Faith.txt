Faith

My faith has faded away
I feel more like shit every day
I’ve lost to many that matters to me
I don’t give a fuck if you disagree
I’ve loved too many times to love again
I just need a true friend

I’m sorry for every pain I might do
But the reason why I might kill myself is because of you
I just need someone to care
Need someone who doesn’t think about what I wear
Everyone I love, I miss
Everyone I care for, I miss
I don’t know how long I can take this
So much mess in my life that I can’t let out
I don’t know anymore what my life is about
Am I going to find what I want? I’m a have my doubt
