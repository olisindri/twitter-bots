About You

When I open my eyes, all I see is you
When I close my eyes, I dream about you….

I care for you, I’ve always do
Whatever happens, I will always love you
I wish I could say what is inside my heart
Wish I had the courage to let the truth out before my heart falls apart
My mind is filled with pictures of you
Your pain is what I’m ready to go through
I can take whatever is going to be on my way
Because I know in the end we will together fly away
