Unforgiven Pain

Someday I might collapse and crawl
I'm on the rock bottom and about to fall
deeper in the shadow of my past
in the unforgiven pain were I might not last
where I might spend the rest of my time
in prison of hell, no mercy for my crime
nothing to lose, and nothing is left
sudden death waits me and it's hard to accept
but it's now my time to pay the depth
