In My Mind

I got this feeling that I don't belong
in your world and everything seems wrong
might the reason be that you don't like me no more
I swear to God I never felt like this before
you're always in my mind, where ever I might end
It doesn't matter as long as I'm holding your hand

By your side, I want to die
In your arms, I want to cry
I want you're loving, to get me high
Don't know what to do
I just wanna love you.....
