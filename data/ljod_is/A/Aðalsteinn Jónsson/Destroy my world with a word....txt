Destroy my world with a word...

I try to hold on, as my hopes slippes away
For my fallen angel, that I lost that day
Every depressed memory I had, are back
I might as well go and put a rope around my neck
No reason for me anymore, breathing has become my enemy
Living, what good can I do for me?
You told me a lie....
But now I want to die....
My heart has fallen apart
Only ashes of pieces remain
I have to die to get away from the pain
I bury my own grave, like from the start
You have now killed my heart.....
