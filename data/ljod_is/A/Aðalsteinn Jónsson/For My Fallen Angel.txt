For My Fallen Angel

Can’t believe I listened to your word
They are the most fake shit I ever heard
You told me you were never going to leave me
You have…

All lies, everything I said was just a joke to you
Do you have any idea what I’ve been through?
I’ve done everything I can to make this good
If I could find a way to die, I would
You don’t know shit, you lied to me
Made me feel so free
But in reality I’m in my own pain
My head is going to blow, I’m going insane
When I look at your picture, I feel nothing
I’m dead because of you…..

I’m mad, I’m sad, bang! I’m dead
