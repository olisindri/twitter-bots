So Close No Matter How Far Part IIII

Every time I thought that I didn’t have a home
Every time I thought that I was on my own
I was right
No matter how hard I try to fight
You will always be out of my sight
How much can I take?
How much until I break
Don’t push me to the edge of time
Don’t rub it in my face that you will never be mine

You have caused me dead
After I lost what I had
I’ve lost everything I want
Everything I’ve owned is gone
