Reality

Reality, hit me hard this morning,
realized IÂ´ve lost you without a warning.
Memories of you and I together,
always tought that we would last forever.
I was stupied, and made a big mistake,
I never meant to take your heart and break.

This is made for you,
I want to tell you the truth,
I love you!
These words are made for you.
