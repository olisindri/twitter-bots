Voracity

Sometimes I forget,
Forget my pain, forget my sorrow,
Sometimes I forget there is tomorrow,
I forget time, and place,
Float on air in time and space.
My memories are just a haze.
So I think about the present, 
I think about the peace,
Will someone just save me, please?

And as I’m floating on free air,
I scream and yell, in quite despair.
Don’t know what will happen now,
Will I ever get back down?
Someone will probably think its fair,
But it’s too much for me to bear.
So I loose my grip and fall to the ground
I fall and I fall forever it seems, 
I finally come down, and I fell to my death,

Would they laugh?
Would they cry?
Would they even notice I died? 

Earth to earth, and dust to dust.

Now I lie here, beneath the ground,
To warm me, only the dirt,
Thinking: I finally got out,
From the pain, and the sorrow,
And now, there is no tomorrow.
Here, only peace and quiet, 
And I said to myself as there I lay,
Here I will stay,
Forever, and have nothing to pay.
