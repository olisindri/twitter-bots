Why???

I don’t understand why
I was left here
I just sit here and cry
and I stand where?

It’s always me
I don’t know why
I hope you can see
I stand here and cry…

I don’t want to leave you here
But you’ve already left me
I wish you could care
That this thing was meant to be…

I feel so cold
I’m just freezing
I hope you get bold
I’m not teasing

I mean the words I say
Nothing can change it
Don’t take them away
Just listen to them a little bit.

You are just the same
A fool like every other men
I stopped playing the game
And now I need a pen.
