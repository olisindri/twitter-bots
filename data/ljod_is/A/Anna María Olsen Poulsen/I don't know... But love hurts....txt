I don't know... But love hurts...

I don’t know what I’m doing
And I don’t know why...
Where are you going!!!
As I sit here and cry...

I can’t believe you did this...
You left me alone...
The only thing I did miss...
Was what I did wrong!!!

Why did you leave me!!!
I want to know why...
I wish you could see,
You left me here to die...

You hurt my heart...
You hurt my soul...
You tore it a part...
The heart you stole...

I don’t know where I stand
I want my life to be fun
So, now I’ve got something in my hand
But it’s only a gun...!
