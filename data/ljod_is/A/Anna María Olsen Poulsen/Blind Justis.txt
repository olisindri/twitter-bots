Blind Justis

This is a story of me
It’s just a little story for you
I only think you can see
Blind justice is true.

This isn’t good
This is just bad
I’m walking in the neighbourhood
I can see that you’re very sad

Blind justice is bad
Because justice shouldn’t be blind
I’m very up sad
Because you, I couldn’t find

All I want is world peace
You won’t leave me
I beg you please
Can you just set me free?
