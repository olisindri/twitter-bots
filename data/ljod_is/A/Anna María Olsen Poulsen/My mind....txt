My mind...

In my mind
In my dream
I am blind
by the stream.

In my head
In my soul
You are dead
And my love you stole

In my mind
In my soul
I was blind
By the love you stole

With your kiss
On my lips
I will miss
all your ships

With my love
in your heart
It comes from above
Donâ€™t tear it a part
