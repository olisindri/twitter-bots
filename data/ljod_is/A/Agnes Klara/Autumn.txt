Autumn

Autumn

 

The wind strokes my cheeks

The leaves whirl by I whirl with the leaves

My naked body remains

Without thought, without soul, without feeling

Bereft

I am in another world

But my body is in its right place

I try to collect my thoughts

My naked body running between the trees

I lose connection with myself

My body runs and runs

But where is the soul

I gather myself

I see the body lying in the grass

My own body

My body is dead

The soul flies up

Often I have not seen the autumn

But I save the memories
