Take Me Back

Take me back when i understood the light,
Take me back when everything fellÂ´d so good
Take me back when the earth had some meaning
Take me back when everything was green 
Take me back when i belived in god
Take me back to the sound of the birds
Take me back to happiness
Take me back to LIFE................!
