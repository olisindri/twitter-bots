To some

To some the cold just feel so right,
sadness purity - blue and grey!
With frozen veins, feel the air.
Flying birds see through glasses of fear

There is dark, there is only a day.
There is light, there is just a night.

With frozen veins, feel the air.
Flying birds see through glasses of fear
