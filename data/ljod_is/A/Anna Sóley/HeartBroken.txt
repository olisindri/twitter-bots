HeartBroken

I was really happy girl
in love with a boy who
I loved so much.
But when we broke up I was lost
Lost in this black world
I didn't know what i could do.
I couldn't live with it,
too see him with another girl
He was so happy, and he was allready
care about me, but i still loved him
And I couldnt make it anymore,
i cryed and cryed on my bed,
I wrote a note to my mom and dad
I said them that i couldnt live anymore 
God needed me so much.
I took my daddys biggest knive
and started to cut, I cut my self 
into pieces, the blood was everywhere
i just couldnt live.
