I\'m sorry

i\'m sorry for what has to be done
i didn\'t exspect for this to become
a reality - not so clear to me
i can\'t believe you don\'t see,
how much you really mean to me.
my life has taken quite a turn, 
i\'m so afraid i\'ll crash and burn,
plz just try to understand,
the cards i hold in my hands.
