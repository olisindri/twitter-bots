Awakening

The strokes of the brush 
touch my soul
not in time nor in space

corners within 
never before touched by color or light 
engulf the new sensations

Forgotten feelings are stirred
memories with few ties left
embroider a new quilt to warm my insides

I´m not alone 

Someone has been here before
time and space don´t exist
only the awareness of recognition
