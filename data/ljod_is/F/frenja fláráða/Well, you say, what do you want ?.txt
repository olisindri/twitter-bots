Well, you say, what do you want ?

You do not wait for my reply.
You do not hear, you do not care.

I believe that love is out there, WHERE ?

Your teeth so white,your skin so bright,
could you stay for one more night?
You do not care, you do not know,
I shall make love within you grow...

But how, I say, what can I do ?
I kneel, I crawl, I fall for you.
You do not hear, You do not see,
You do not care to care for me.

All this I know but still I fall...
ThereÂ´s love for one and love for all.
But maybe the mistake is mine
alone I kneel, I crawl, I cry.

I believe that love is out there, WHY ?

Tomorrow is another day, 
I shall have love,
I know I may,
I wanted yours,it was not there.

I believe that love is out there,
do I CARE?
