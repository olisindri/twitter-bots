alone

alone
so alone
nobody needs me
nobody seeks me
feel like i´m falling apart
feel like i´m dying inside
can you help me 
can you give me your hand

oh lord i call out your name
don´t know how to pray
i´m dying inside
need you by my side
deep in my heart
i don´t know how to open the door again
