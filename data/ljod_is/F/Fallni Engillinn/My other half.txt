My other half

How often have I sat and looked out my window,
and hardly realized what was outside?
How often have I sat and thought about you,
and felt like I could travel at the speed of light?
How often have I wished that you were here with me,
and not so many miles away as you are?
And how often have I written a poem about love,
-with only you in my mind?

I just can't get you out of my head;
your voice, and your touch.
I lie in my bed and feel like a part of me is missing, 
And I feel that you're supposed to be there.
It's like my heart was torn in two parts,
and one part isn't here.
An emptyness is surrounding my heart,
It hurts and I let out a tear.

I need to find the other part, and I think I know where to look.
I think you have a half of my heart; 
at least my whole mind you took.
