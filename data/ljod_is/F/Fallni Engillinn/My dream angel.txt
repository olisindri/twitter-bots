My dream angel

I held you in my arms
but then you started to fade,
dissolved into the thin air around me.

I sensed/felt(?) you in the air,
I tried to breathe you in
but I knew that you were gone.

I tried to look for you,
I wanted you again,
to lie here in my arms.

But you were already gone,
gone, just like a dream,
like an angel from my dream.

My dearest dream angel,
Please come again.
Please. Come again...

I want to fall asleep 
and sleep forever more,
just for the chance to see you again.
