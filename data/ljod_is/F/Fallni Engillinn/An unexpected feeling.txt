An unexpected feeling

This unexpected feeling, I’ve felt it before.
Even when you’re near me, I feel the horror.
Of this unexpected feeling, why here, why now?
Why do I feel it? Why, and how?

When I’m supposed to feel so good, and life is going well,
I’m in love with you, and you love me as well,
When life seems to be like the children’s play
This unexpected feeling, I feel my decay

This unexpected feeling is the loathing of life,
Life and all that follows, the love and the strife.
And only when you touch me and gently kiss my lips,
This unexpected feeling is taken over by a bliss.
