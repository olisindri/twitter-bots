Emotions

Hating, disgusting, loathing,
Loving, beautiful, caring.
sarcastic, egotistical, full.
Depressed, closed, empty.

Feeling emotions, all at once.
how can I feel, so much.
Was my heart, really built, for this pain?
It hurts to feel, your touch.

It's exploding with emotions,
too many to bear.
I see the shattered pieces,
Flying through the air.

As I slowly gather them together,
To mend my broken heart.
My vision comes clearer and clearer;
It doesn't really matter that much.

For with my heart, the emotions come back, 
And I'll be back where I were.
And a comfortable numbness comes over my brain,
As I walk away in a blur.
