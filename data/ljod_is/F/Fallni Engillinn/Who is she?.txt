Who is she?

A fair, little girl, in a pretty white gown,
(like an angel, or maybe a fairy)
Walking in the playground, sits down on the swings.
(But all the children have gone)

Standing. (alone) Sits down. (abandoned)

Like an angel.
(But she's missing her halo)
Like a fairy.
(But she's missing her wings)

Maybe she's been cast out of Heaven?
