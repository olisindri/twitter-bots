Illusions

Walking in the desert without water.
Dying of thirst.
Seeing water everywhere.
Illusions, tricking me, giving me false hopes.
 
Walking through life without you.
Dying of thirst.
Feeling your touch, hearing your voice, smelling your aroma.
Illusions, tricking me, giving me false hopes.
