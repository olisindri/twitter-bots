What my senses really want

Lying in my bed,
staring at the ceiling.
(But not seeing anything)
Listening to the rain.
(But not hearing anything)

Sitting by the window,
Watching people walk by,
(but not seeing anything)
Listening to their thoughts
(but not hearing anything)

Sitting in class,
Watching the teacher write,
(But not seeing anything)
Listening to him explain,
(but not hearing anything)

For all my eyes want to see is your face,
All my ears want to hear is your voice,
All my lips want to touch are yours,
All my fingers want to feel is your skin against mine.
