A thousand-and-one-piece

I look in the mirror, and I see someone else.
Some other girl that I don't recognize.
She moves like nobody I've ever seen,
but her mouth is full of lies.

She tells me I'm disgusting, in my innocense I believe.
And my self-esteem starts drowning,
till I no longer want to live.

But then one day I wake up,
like from an ugly dream
And I shout at the girl, 'shut up!'
and to my surprise I see,
that the girl there in the mirror,
is noone else but me.
and angry I break the mirror
into a thousand-and-one piece.
