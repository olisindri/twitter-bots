Hel

She is dark, she is dread,
she's the queen of the dead.
she is divine, she is delight,
she's the deity of the night.

Her dance is defiant,
dazzling is her face.
Her derision is dire,
deadly is her gaze.

In the darkness she dwells.
In the dephts of Hell itslef.
In the debris of the dawn
the daylight is gone.


In the daybreak I die,
with my dagger I lie.
My doomed soul descends,
The blood on my knife, drenched.
