A Fallen Angel

Alone, cast out of Heaven.
Embraced by darkness.
The warm embrace of the cold dark.
She feels dirty.
Expelled from Heaven,
forever,
Never to return.
With the only company of the cold darkness.
The darkness that holds its arms around her.
Holds her tightly so she won't get away.

Eyes in the dark, like tiny stars.
Always watching, always hating.
Always whispering - what do they say?
She can't hear them, and she doesn't want to.
Lies down, covers her ears, only to hear more whispering.
This time the whispering comes from within her own head.
Covers her eyes, only to see more darkness, more glaring eyes, staring at her with these icy, cold eyes.
