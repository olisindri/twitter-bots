Sunset

The sun is lying down to sleep, as she slowly closes her eyes, she colours the world.
Red, pink, purple and blue.
Then she slowly falls asleep, and the light that brightens the sky in the day, she lends to the moon and the stars.
The sky grows darker, the colour of the darkest of blue, it's like satin or silk.
It's the same colour as I see when I look into your eyes, and I see the moonlight's reflect.
