The teenage years

Sometimes you can't stop laughing,
but suddenly you want to die.
Sometimes you want for no reason at all,
lie down on your bed and cry.

Sometimes you think you're madly in love,
but the next minute... you're not.
Sometimes you think that everything's unfair,
and you want to scream... alot. 

And that's what the teenage years are like,
the hormones are driving you mad.
You never know what the fuck you want,
and everything is so sad.
