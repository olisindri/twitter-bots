I couldn´t be blinder

It all started as a game
then it got real
so real that I couldn´t stop
thinking about you
I couldn´t be blinder

You said "I love me"
of course I said "I love you too"
It seemed so innocent
but I just saw it all wrong
I couldn´t be blinder

You always talked so sweet to me
but it stoped being sweet when
when you started telling me
how to behave all the time
I couldn´t be blinder

I was so deeply in love with 
you, everything was always about
you, everything I did, I did for 
you, were my only one
I couldn´t be blinder

A friend came to me one day
screamed at me "wake up"
I didn´t understand my friend
and told him to go away
I couldn´t be blinder

When I didn´t do everything
you liked you got so mad,it hurted
then I started to understand my friend
he warned me, why didn´t I listen
I couldn´t be blinder

After a long time, too long
I woke up and told you
in your face I said
"It´s over"
I could see clear again
