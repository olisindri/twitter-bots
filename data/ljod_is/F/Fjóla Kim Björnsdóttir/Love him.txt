Love him

Love is when you can´t sleep,
because you don´t ever want
to stop looking at
him.

Love is when it´s hard to get out of bed,
because in his arms you
feel so safe, just with
him.

Love is when you want to go out,
because you´re so proud
to be his girl, only with
him.

Love is when you don´t care,
because everything you need
and every thing you want is
him.

Love is when you feel like shit,
because it hurts so fucking
much when you´re not with 
him.
