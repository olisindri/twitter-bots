I´m just a friend

You came to me with so fucked up
blood on your cloths and a black-eye.
You didn´t seem to trust anybody
so sceared of everyone who came near you.

I always did my best to help you
feeding you and washing you.
I never ever gave up on you
even though you gave up on me.

She said that she didn´t believe
how you looked and what had happend.
She never understood how much you
fought for her, cuz you loved her.

We went through the worst and best
times together and stood by each others side.
We were always ment to be together
but I´m still just a friend helping you...
