LORD, TAKE ME HOME

Lord, come on and take me home
I can’t stand here all alone
The blue bird told me to return back
take all my things in a sack

Thinking of the country side
the pickup and my gun
What my father and my mother said
I just needed to have fun
I am going home

I miss my field upon the hill
Where the peace is upon me
And my old friend BILL
He is chilling out there as you see

10 dollar bill 
is the only thing I’ve got
I haven’t been earning alot
What I see in the clear blue sky
Is going home and 
eat my mothers apple pie
