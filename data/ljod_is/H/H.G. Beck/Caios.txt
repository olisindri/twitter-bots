Caios

In a world of hunger,
in a world of war,
in a world of violens,
as a cloud under the stars,

If you wanna live through it,
if you wanna see through. 

You better have strength
and know what you want,
gife what you have and,
take what you want. 

It´s not always easy,
it´s not always right.

But the thing is to feel it
the thing is to see, 
be what you are, 
to see what you feel. 

In a world of hunger,
in a world of war,
in a world of violens,
. . . . . . . . . . . . is a caios.
