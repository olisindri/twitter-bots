1 Logan Place

Standing in front of the forever young
who faded away with his loneliest song
had never a place in the natural throng
along with my soul embraces.

Touching a stone is a tragical kneel
is telling my world that I can still feel.
The magical seed is making us heal
and wheeling my sight for tomorrow.

Those years in the fame when I found out your name
my footprint at home was never the same.
My home was the sound when the harmony came
I just have to admit when I hear you.
