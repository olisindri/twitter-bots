Why wasn´t it meant to be?

Why wasn´t it meant to be,
just tell me and I´ll change,
Why wasn´t it meant to be,
just tell me and I´ll change.

What do you wan´t me to do,
just tell me and it will be,
you have been so nice to me,
always showed me what to see.

Maybe there is hope for us,
I´ll try my very best,
I know if we just try enough,
we´ll get there in the rest,

I´m sorry love I know it´s true,
I just don´t want to believe,
In my heart your the one,
and will always be.

I know there is no hope for us,
I tried my very best,
We never tried enough,
and didn´t make it in the rest.
