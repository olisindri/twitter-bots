IT with me

Every cloud the sun breaks 
at the morning I wake. 
I´ll be thinking about you. 
Babe you know i feel blue 

Every sunrise i see 
they all remind me of you 
every sunset i see 
I know theres a day 
done of waiting 
 
All this time that I'm alone. 
I´ll be waiting for you. 
All this time that im blue 
Ill be thinking of you 
 
but there's a comforting thougt 
that warms me inside 
That one day my darling 
you'll be right at my side. 

At every sunrise I see 
you´ll be sitting by me 
At every sunset I'll see 
you'll be watching 
it with me.
