In a box

That single time
We had some fun
Paid me the price
Of a life time of  thoughts

I can not express 
Thoes feeling I feel
Without making myself
Drink a shit lode of beer 

Don’t know why
And still don’t know how
I’m writing these lines
And sending you now

Tell me to stop
Or I keep on forever 
Writing these lines
Of a Love twisted mind…
 
In a box with a 
Alcohol lock on
