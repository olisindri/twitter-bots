International Lovers

Where ever I am
I´ll be thinking of you
In Spain or in France
You´ll hunt me like glue

All the glory of Scotland
All the wonders in Greece
They wont match your beauty
They wont match my pain

The search for my love
The hunt to be happy
I Will travel the earth
Where are you?

All this money I spent
To all these countreis i went
I was searching for you
All this time you were here

Right by my side
Right in my lap
why did´nt I noteist
You by my side all the time.
