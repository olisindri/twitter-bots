My Best Friend

I don’t wanna lose you,
I don’t wanna lose you.
Again.
I don’t wanna lose you,
I don’t wanna lose you.
My friend.

You pulled me out from inside.
You kept faith when I cried.
We have gone through so much.

All the laughter, all the crying,
we did care, we did care.

Uncomfortable silence, there was none.
Hits below the belt, there were some
Please don’t leave it would hurt so much.

All the laughter, all the crying,
I do care, I do care.

I cried myself to sleep last night,
of the thought of you saying goodbye.
‘Cause I don’t want to lose you

I don’t want this.
As stupid as this 
to tear us apart,
apart from,
one another

You helped me live
when I thought I’d die.
My best friend,
don’t leave me behind.

All the laughter, all the crying,
Do you still care? Do you care?

I don’t wanna lose you,
I don’t wanna lose you.
My best friend.
