Ripped

I keep coughing and coughing
and coughing up blood.
As you ripped out my heart,
you opened a flood.
You stand there in front of me
and give me that smile.
never did I think that you
could ever be so vile.
Now I am lying, lying here,
on the ground and turning blue.
Still you just stand there
hovering above, saying \"it\'s true,
it\'s a fact that you just 
can\'t live without it\"
I manage to say to him;
\"Really?! No SHIT!\"
