Conflicted Underneath

My big blue eyes they cover nothing
if you look too closely.
My blonde beautiful hair might as well
be ripped and scattered.
I just can\'t see this thing they see.
The beauty they say lies within me.
At times I wonder by the reef,
and wonder why I\'m so conflicted underneath.
