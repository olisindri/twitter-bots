Crazy Daisy

My beauty has forever gone.
My life it ended with a song.
Happiness Iâ€™ve never known.
The seed of evil has been sown.
He did not have the heart to linger.
My soul he just had given the finger.
Crazy little daisy girl.
She only wanted one little word.
Crazy little daisy girl.
As graceful as a singing bird.
