Waiting.

i just wrote you a letter
it had my soul
my heart
and spelling mistakes.

read from your soul
keep it by your chest
or just use it for fire 
when you get chilles to night,
Im waiting
for the brake, 
the chanse
or just plain luck to come along.

if i dit then i ditint 
if i was then i wasnt 
if i tried i forgot it 
if im here im there
i know you are there 
but wish you were here
then i could meet you.
