Distance.

There is a bridge to cross,
are we going to make it?
coming from different worlds
crossing on the chance 
of happines.

I meet you,saw you fellt you
living my life with in you
leaping through the hole
finding no ground only
my values flying by me.


I crawled into my self and cryed
i shouted out and you was deaf
i touched you and you turned away
i missed you,yeat you was next to me
your silence you isolated me 
in sorrow i left.
