Changes

im killing my time with changes
im getting it out while i can
im letting the rush go through me
im living life as a man

im seeing things with my emotions
im getting it all while i can
im letting you know im here for you
and im here free until the end

the changes are coming and going
i celebrate them each time 
it means im learning and growing
it means im getting it right.

the people i pass are not strangers
they are partners in crime
the crime is living life to its fullest
its the one crime that is mine.

i dont fear death or its jugdes 
i dont fear loving you now
its all changes yours and mine

maybe tomorow its different
i dont really have a clue
all i know to day im happy
and hopefully so are you.

my changes are coming and growing
im learning and getting it right
but each time im living and loving
i have to camp out for the night.

so lets forget pain and sorrow 
lets love and live our life

one of these days it will be over
we will pack our bags and go home
with noting but what he have been 
learning and feeling what has already 
grown.
