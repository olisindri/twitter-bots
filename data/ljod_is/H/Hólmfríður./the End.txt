the End

give us a sound 
give us a spell
lets do this honey
you know me to well

for this is us
and that was i
and this is were
i say good bye

it was good, it was swell 
we gave it a try
we dit it well

dont be sad think happy thought
i know its crap but 
thats all i got

dont let big things
get to small
lets let the words talk
Cause they say it all
at least for a while
we had a ball
