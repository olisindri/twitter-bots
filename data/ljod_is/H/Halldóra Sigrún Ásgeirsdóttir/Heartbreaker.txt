Heartbreaker

i hate the way you look at me
i don\'t know what you\'re gonna see
am I too ugly for your friends
I\'m dealing with a lot of ends

Can\'t you just leave me alone
I\'ve never broken any bone
so I\'m not going to let you rule
breaking my heart was not so cool

I hate you and I want you to see
what you are making me be
i hate you, i hate you, i want you to die
this was my message F*ck you and bye
