My gibberish love

I love you
like the sky
all blue
and no lie

I hate you 
like the grass
you really are
a dumbass

I miss you
like the snow
never there
you have to know

i want you
more then life
and I hope to be
your future wife

I can\'t held it
talk gobberish
love me
that\'s my wish
