\"where are you?\"
\"why aren\'t you here?\"
\"when are you coming?\"
I drink another beer

\"hello you haven\'t come..\"
\"I miss you lots\"
and I drink
few vodka shots.

\"goddamn you motherf*cker,
you didn\'t show up!
I hate you and this life,
F*CK\"

this story ends
with a little girl lying
on the ground
dying.

and her last questions
are on his phone
waiting to be answered
but she can\'t hear a tone

there she lies
that little girl
no one finds her
and her pearl.
