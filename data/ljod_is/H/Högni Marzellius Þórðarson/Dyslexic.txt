Dyslexic

No one knows how lost u can get
In this big world of words
Iâ€™m so blinded be the trees
I can see the forest
My head looks fore feelings
I can spell
And I wonder, will I ever be like u 
Will I ever see things ur way
Hoping fore understanding 
I get none, thrown a way
Like yesterdays news 
The story of my life
Wrongly spelled
The mind of a dyslexic
