Distance

Long time’s gone without a trace
we were lost in unknown maze
Never heard and never seen
though in my heart you’ve always been
there you’ll always have a special place

I’ve found you now and want to keep
you in my arms while you sleep
to make you calm, to make you ease
live our lifes with love and pease
and I know my feelings are so deep

Every night to God I pray
and every night I hear him say
not to worry for you and me
we were always ment to be
our love will grow from day to day
