Lost

I search the room 
Nowhere to be found
Were did you go 
Who is to blame?
I ask 
No one to tell

The only thing I know, 
It wasn’t your choice
Who took you away?
You beautiful girl

I search again 
Nowhere to be seen
Where is your smile? 
I can still hear you 
Again 
Where did you go?

Some things aren’t right
Why you?
Why not someone I didn’t know
I need a reason 
I need to know

The only thing I know, 
It wasn’t your choice
Who took you away?
My beautiful friend

I turn my back 
Look one more time
Your bed is empty 
Only your case but no you
I still feel you

The one thing I know, 
It wasn’t your choice
Why take you away?
My beautiful angel...
