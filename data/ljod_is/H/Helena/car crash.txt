car crash

We crashed
All I saw was blood and bloken glass
I looked for you
Are you alive?
There you were
Didn’t move, are you alive?
I tried to call your name but I couldn’t talk
Somebody, please help me and my friend
I was stuck and couldn’t move 
I had to lie there and watch you die
I saw you eyes open
But you said: I love you and then your eyes closed again
I will always remember you
Just hug me in my dreams
