You are gone

Now the time has gone
When we laughed and cried together
Now my life will be lonely without you
I always hear your voice, telling me that you love me
But it is always my imagination
I know what we will never meet again
I know I will never feel your touch, your kisses again
Thinking about that, I can\'t explain
It just makes me want to cry and never be happy again.
