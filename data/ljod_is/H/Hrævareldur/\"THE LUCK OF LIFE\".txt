\"THE LUCK OF LIFE\"

No money, no honey
Don’t waist your life on numbers
No honey, no money
Don’t spend your life on numbers

And when you’er closed to a deal
And you like to have a good meal
And sometimes you’er lost, lonely and blue
And no one is really true

No money, no honey
Don’t waist your life on numbers
No honey, no money
Don’t spend your life on numbers

Sometimes you don’t have a penny in your pocket
And you feel like a rocket
You think for yourself what can I do
I ask myself “How can you”

No money, no honey
Don’t spend your life on numbers
No honey, no money
Don’t waist your life on numbers

The luck of life is to face the reality
And bring forward the best you can
Don’t wait, just seek for your own destiny
And see the future bright ahead.
