under the sun

Everything under the sun is imagination, nothing is real. Yet all laws are true. How can this be so?  Man is the expression of the most basic force of nature. In so being, he is blind to his own role.

The basic force of nature, that rules everything, is love. From it comes gravity, the physics of Einstein, and the beauty from the Hubble telescope. How can this be possible? Man has mastered the basic forces of nature, in so doing he personifies them.

Rule my friend, rule your own life. That which is given, is the source of the universe. Do not waste time in idle thinking. Be the master of the source, and overcome the boundaries of human existence.
