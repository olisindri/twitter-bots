Summer breeze

Stretch my hands against the sky,
embracing the warmth of the sun.

Time is engaging summer,
both in the season
and in my heart.

I feel I can fly like an eagle,
soar up in the sky, 
closer to the sun than ever before,
And I feel free.

As I fly trough the air,
I sense the majesty of the One
by whom I can breathe
the refreshment of
summer breeze.
