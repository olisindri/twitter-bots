Helpless

Lost in the fog of eternity,
Will they ever reach out their hand to me?
Lonely words are written in the sand,
Soon my days will come to an end.

I see a vision of a naked tree, 
Birds above flying free.
The storm of the cold sea, 
No one is here to rescue me.
The time sits still,
I will be waiting for you untilâ€¦
I will be waiting for you in heaven.
