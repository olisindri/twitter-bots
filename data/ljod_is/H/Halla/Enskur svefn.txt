Sleep isn\'t what we think.
It\'s not rest into which we sink.
Instead it\'s reality in a way
where the small people have a say,
where that baby didn\'t die,
where that small girl didn\'t cry,
where his son didn\'t fail,
where her husband didn\'t go to jail,
where Jesus was black,
where he actually did get her in the sack.
Sleep is reality where dreams come true,
everyone can make it through.

Yes, even you.
