There is just ridicoulus

In the bank, in the bank
and I just have few penny
penny left, penny left

2.VERSE
The sun is shining 
the children are playing
in the street, 
in the street,
If I were a stockbroker
I would be 
Rich as a creep
Rich as a creep

CHORUS
Now I am sitting in the sunlight
dreaming of you, waiting for you
I just hope and pray that
My dreams will come true
My dreams will come true
Sitting in the sunlight
and waiting for you
Dreaming for you

3.VERSE
If there would be any hope
I would meet the Pope
Meet the pope
Give a speech on his balcony
and ask God
Give me some money 
Give me some money

CHORUS
