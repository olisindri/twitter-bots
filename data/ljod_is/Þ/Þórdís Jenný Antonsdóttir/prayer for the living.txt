prayer for the living

Why does the thought of death 
The feeling of ending this life 
The torture, the pain, the hurt 
The discomfort I cause, 
Why does it feel so right? 

But the thought of the pain 
The mechanics, the method 
The hows and wherefores.. 
Why is that so beyond me, 
my abilities, My confidence? 

I know I would be better dead 
All I care for is others 
All I do is hurt others 
All I want to do is leave others 
To their lives away from me 

Is my inability from caring? 
Knowing the final act of hurt 
The final ability to screw others 
To give those who truly care 
A pain even I haven\'t done before? 

But they would recover 
And they could see it was done 
Maybe not consciously, but truly 
For the best for them 
And therefore the best for me. 

Is it fear that stops me? 
The inability to take the pain 
I couldn\'t inflict on myself 
The yellow man I am, 
The quitter, never finishing the Job 

So I carry on to conceal the feelings 
Trying to do all I can for all 
And still I hurt and give pain 
Cause confusion wherever I go 
That is why I pray to die.
