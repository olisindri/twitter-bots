The one

Not knowing 
dont knowing 
I will never know 
how it feels to be 
alive 

I lie alone 
here in my room 
my mind is emty 
like my life 
all i have is 
all i have is 
to wait untill 
the one comes 
to get me 
take me away 
away from the pain 
the pain that wrists 
so hard in my heart 
Only the one 
can take it away 
by bringing me hate 
that one is the death
