To a beautiful stranger

My beautiful strange girl
in surgery room
I was brought here in a curl
to face my doom.

Because I have been weak
but you make me stronger
all that I seek 
is to live longer.

So come what may
I´m so glad I saw you
first time today
you smiled to me too.

Now I have purpose
something to live for
lift up the curtains
I´m here to score.

It´s turning late
you can tuck me in
I accept my fate
let the games begin.

You make me go dream
about you and me
as if we were team
and eternally free.

In a world full of love
our feelings would shine
like in heaven above
if you would be mine.

And if I should die
and forever sleep
then please do not cry
I´m not worthy your weep.

But I want you to know
I won´t settle for less
than our love to grow
up in Heaven.....I guess.
