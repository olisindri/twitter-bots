Love

To my daughter and my son in law

Love can make you happy,
love can make you glad
love can make you lonesome
and love can make you sad
Some are even sorry
for love they've never had

Love is a thing to cherish.
love is a thing to share.
Let your love not perish,
lend it extra care,
so love stops you being lonely,
so love will make you whole.

Such love will enhance your gladness,
such love will make you rich.
Such love will lessen your sadness.
Such love will lessen your itch,
for something that doesn't matter,
or something that doesn't exist.
