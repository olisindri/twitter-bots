Forgotten love

Those are the light footsteps that you barely hear
coming from somewhere not quite far, not quite near,
something like an unheard whisper behind your ear.
There is nothing to see,nothing to feel,
nothing that could be real.
Maybe it is your long forgotten love
trying to reach you from somewhere beyond, somewhere above,
struggling to let you see
how things could be
in the next eternity.
