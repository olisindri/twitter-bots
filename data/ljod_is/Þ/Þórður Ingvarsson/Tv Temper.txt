Tv Temper

Trying to refrain myself from spouting vile poisouns bile
against the TV-shows, nowadays.
Is this REALLY what the public wants to see?
Is this REALLY like the public wants to be?
This may seem a bit repeated - 
the questions I ask...that is...
But what the public wants today... 
I mean, you know, It´s, you know ...
it´s REALLY disturbing.
I mean, REALLY REALLY disgusting
Repeated this may seem a bit -
But still I wonder - you know
The infuriating urine-soaked piece of old ... erm ...
EXCREMENT that they fill the brains of the innocent...
This horrible piece of multi-million dollar 
(pound, yen or euro
depends on where you are, you know) 
that they thrust into your ears and eyes!
(Fornicating with your senses)
May this seem a bit repeated?
It´s a bit too much - it´s true
Ooooh, I forgot 
but do I not tell the truth?
I don´t know...
hand me the remote
(off)

afraid to miss some fantastic show
or an excellent music video
listening to it in stereo
on a digital 56\" television screen
A bit repeated - this may seem
(just in time
for a new rhyme)
But..
I must contain myself
But I can´t resist...
WHY NOT SPENT THIS MONEY 
TO MAKE US FREE!
JUST STOP THIS MADNESS,
AT LEAST FOR ONE DAY!
please?
