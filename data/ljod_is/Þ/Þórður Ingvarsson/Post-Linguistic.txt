Post-Linguistic

Having trouble to communicate
some problem with my linguistic expertise
Words try to form 
Sentences erupt from the front of my lobe
But what my mouth tries to ejaculate
Is gibberish;
But I try... 
to say... to shout... 
and cry.
But I smile.

Extremely satisfied with this change
of mine.
