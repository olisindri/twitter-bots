something.

i have wondered this planet for days
and all i have found is people smiling.
once i found nothing.

in the center of it all my biggest fear has come to reality ... living.
children running down the streets,
laughter, people in love.
i dinÂ´t noticed that before.

its sunny, once it was raining.

i fall in the water and drown with only joy in my heart.
