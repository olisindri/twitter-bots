kill me.

god please kill me,
so i can bring him back to life.
god please kill me,
so i can hold him again.
cut out my heart and give to him,
so i can hear his heartbeat.
cut out my tounge and give to him.
so he can speak of beauty again.
take off my skin and give to him, 
so i can look at his face without scars.
take off my lips and give them to him,
so he wont have to go with stiches in his.
take out my teeth and give them to him,
so i can see his beautiful smile again.
at last take out my soul and give it to him,
so he can say that he loves me again.
god please kill me,
so i can bring him back to life.
god please kill me,
so i can hold him again.
