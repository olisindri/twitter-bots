your heart

like a big drum, it beats slowly and loudly.
when i listen to it,
i feel so quiet so calm.
this is the thing that keeps you breathing,
keeps you alive.
this is all you.
no one has the same noise in their heartbeat.
and yours is just.....yours.
i think, i don´t think
i can only see, see you.
