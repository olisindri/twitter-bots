save tonight.

thereÂ´s no place to go.
when hearts are lost and so on.
the memory of you is so pure and true.
i will live for you,
stay strong for you,
so just let go and say goodbye.
i love you, you are the best.
you were my big brother.
it will be strange to never see you again, but my heart is full of pictures of you.

i will miss you,
i may cry,
but they are not tears of sorrow,but tears of joy, because i know that you are save tonight.
