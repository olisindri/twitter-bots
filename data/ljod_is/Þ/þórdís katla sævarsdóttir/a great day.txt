a great day

i was born, in fear i drowned.
i knew one day would come a great day.
the day i died.

black clouds all surrounded me.
the salt in the sea cleared away.
the blood in my veins dryed up,
and the the skin of my body was so attempting.

I took the knife so tender
I tore open my wrist
Yes it's a great day
for now i dance in death.
for now i sleep.
