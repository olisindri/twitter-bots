my baby

his first smile,
his first laugh,
his first giggle.

his first words,
his first steps,
his first dinner.

the smell of his hair,
the touch of his hands,
the soft kisses on my cheek,
these blue eyes that stare.

my closest thing,
my first fear,
my first happy tears,
my real life,
my first newborn son.
