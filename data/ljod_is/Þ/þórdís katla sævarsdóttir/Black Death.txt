Black Death

if i fall asleep, then wake me.
so i don´t fall into my ugly world of petreyal.

were nobody can see me or how bad i can be.
the water drowns me in blood there.
i can´t stand up, can´t call for help.

were things are done to me,
were people hurt.
were i die.

if i could wake forever, i would...
then i feel safe, so safe.

black tears of sorrow, they take me trough the night.
again and again.

and when the morning comes, be there-(x2).
