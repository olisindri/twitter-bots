WHY I AM THIS WAY.

if you get to close, i´ll push you away.
because i have been stolen so many times.
you know i bleed inside,
so thank you for staying.
i don´t wanna waist any time,
i want it all now.
before you wake up and relize that im nothing.
im covered by skin,
so undress me, make me feel.
be real, let me know that you are there.
sometimes i know, but i can´t see.
all the times that i have played dead,
is just to get away, to be cold.
sometimes i feel nothing because it hurts to feel.
once we were, now we are, but how long?
my grave is ready for my lost darkness.
so let me be in peace, just stay.
i´ll get better, all for you and all for me...us.
we were meant to be...fait.
today is fucked up, tomorrow will be okey.
so, need while i bleed.
hold me, when its cold.
understand, what i don´t understand.
if you don´t, just pretend.
just see in me, see how good i can be.
