my pain.

long time ago, i felt pain.
long time ago, i felt sceard.

for a while my mind was not in the right place,
for a while i could hear my heart cry.

it´s funny how one thing can change your life,
who you trust and who you love.

i find it hard just getting up in the mornings,
im sceard of living...what a chicken!

i don´t want you to see in me,
because all you will find is sorrow.

i want to feel your arms around me in the night,
then maybe i can sleep with my door unlocked.
