I WANT YOU TO KNOW

when everything has drowned in your world,
i want to be the one drying things up for you.

when you have been in a fight,
i want to be the one kissing your scars.

when you cry and laugh,
i want to be the one holding you.

when you get sceard,
i want to be the one telling you that everythings going to be okey.

i want you to know,
i want you to know,
i want you to know that im here.
