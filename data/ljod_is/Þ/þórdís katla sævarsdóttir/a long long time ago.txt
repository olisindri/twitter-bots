a long long time ago

a long long time ago,
seeing you soul.
these words just cut my heart,
and my sun went down.

my world came down again,
and you touched my hand like a devil child
and down in blood i drowned
and my body got numbed
i asked you to stop
but you just went on and on and on again.

your face, your smile...
just went up in flames,
no shame,just game
i was put in a dark place.

im just crying
i canÂ´t stop hiding

you face...in flames.
