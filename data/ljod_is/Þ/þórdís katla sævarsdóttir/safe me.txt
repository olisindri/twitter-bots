safe me

im covered in blood.
it runs down my face and i ask for forgiveness.
my heart so black by what i did today.
im not fine.
i feel your voice and screaming burning my face.
its getting cold.
its so easy to give up now,
but i canÂ´t.
please help me trough this pain i have hidden.
please.
