afraid to love you

in the night, i wake
watching you as you lie there,
so quiet so calm.
feel the uglyness inside fly away.
you make me who i am today.
my sick toughts seem so far away.
your skin so soft, so beautiful you are.
your breath so steady and deep.
feel so save with you.
you strong like a man but 
soft like a little boy inside.
all this room for you,
but still can´t let you in.
a part of me can´t live without you,
and a part of me is afraid of you.
im afraid of you because i love you so much.
and maybe you will go away,
then im left with nothing.
just a grave to play with.
