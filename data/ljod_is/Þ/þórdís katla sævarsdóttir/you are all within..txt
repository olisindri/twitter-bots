you are all within.

when i say no, i really mean yes.
im just questioning how much you really want to be here with me.
i got you were i want you now, and im never letting go.
because after three years of saddness you got me smiling with the words i never thought i hear again.

with all my soul,
with all my heart,
i love you more than anything,
tough sometimes it is hard to let go of the love i never had.
i am so used to dreaming about you, that sometimes i don´t belive that you are really here,
so i act sometimes like i don´t care.
