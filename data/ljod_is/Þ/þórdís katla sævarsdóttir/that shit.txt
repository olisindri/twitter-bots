that shit

when the night comes in,
i think about what he did,
my body starts to shake and my soul closes.
i close my eyes and imagine everything is okey.
then i feel your arms around me and remember,
how loved i am and the fright goes away.
as long as you are here with me nothing can touch me.
you open your eyes and ask if im okey.
i always say yes so you can sleep.
but im wishing we can go haunting.
so i can feel save again.
i want that fucker dead.
i wish that thing would go away but it will never go.
that feeling, that stupid feeling.
that feeling of blackness and surrender.
i canÂ´t hide myself from you anymore, tears just run down my face.
and you look at me with that beautiful face,
and just make me all better again.
i love you.
