Friends for ever and even longer

When no one ever looks your way,
And no one says you’re nice today.
And no one sends you smiles across the floor.
When there is no love left for you,
And all the world is gray and blue.
And deep inside your heart you’re feeling poor.

When you feel like you have missed the train,
And everything you’ve got is pain.
And deep inside you’re slowly growing old. 
When everything that’s good is gone,
And you are never having fun.
And all your world is slightly going cold.

Remember I am here my friend,
And friendship never comes to end.
Though sometimes we are very mad and sore.
You never have to run and hide,
Cause I am always by your side.
So let the friendship last for evermore.
