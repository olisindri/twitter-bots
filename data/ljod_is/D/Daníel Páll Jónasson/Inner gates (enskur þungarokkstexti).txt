Inner gates (enskur þungarokkstexti)

on my knees I humbly pray
“not another fucked up day!?”
god stays silent like before
my heart dies a little more
cold and shaking
old and aching
I feel the pain inside the core!

trapped inside my vanity
fucked up by insanity
tears of acid burn the eyes
something here inside me dies!

on my face so I can’t see
just how life has treatened me
loveless is the one who hates
darkness behind walls awaits
for the ones who
won’t admit to
open up their inner gates!

trapped inside my vanity
fucked up by insanity
tears of acid burn the eyes
something here inside me dies!

...

closing all feelings inside
fighting myself each night
sorrows are filling my heart
tearing this muscle apart...

sorrows are filling my heart
tearing this
fucking hard
acid burnt
glacier cold muscle 
apart...

...

so I’ll open up my inner gates
for something out there that waits
for me
for something out there that longs
for me
for something out there that will
save me

on my knees
so please
save me...

on my knees
so please
save me...

please just
save me...
