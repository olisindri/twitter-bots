Hearts of stone

I walk through the empty desert crying
with a heartful of secrets and feelings
behind me teardrops on sand are lying...

go down on my knees and think
think about my one love
the love I left in haste
the love that went to waste...

I look in agony at a nearby sandstone
the stone is little, cold and dry
just like my dried up heart
weak and about to die...

I sculpt a heartlike figure in the stone
with a sharp but rusty knife
cold like my pointless life...

I watch the figure – see my heart just there
I know my heart is cold and hard
I wish my heart was better and warmer
but the heart before my eyes
the heart I made with stone
is the heart I lost
cold as knife
hard as bone...

from my eyes the acid tears still ooze
now I know there’s nothing more to lose
I take up the heartlike figure
throw it on the ground
with a breaking sound...

I can see the truth now
but I already knew it
my heart made a mistake
my heart is a stone
my heart is hard
but hearts of stone can also
break...

cannot go back to the life I knew
cannot go back to you
cannot make the smile grow back
wanna paint my blue eyes black
so I won’t see the beauty I lost
the beauty I miss the most...

will not give up this long-lost fight
fight myself and memories every night
I know you’re gone and will forever be
never giving up and coming back to me
while I live in a room that’s dim
I know you’re loving him...

I can see the truth right now
The truth I already knew
never again loving you
my stupid heart made a fucking mistake
this bone-hard-muscle can also break
if I could just take something back
to mend my life – this wreck
i’d take back the kiss of the poisonous kind
so I could be the man again
the one I left behind...

my heart made a little mistake
my heart will die and finally break
all alone...

my little cold heart of stone...
