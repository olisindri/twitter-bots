Preaching Atheist

you think you’re welcome up
for your deeds and glory
for your daily grace
but when you’re lying rotten
and forgotten in the mud
I’d really like to see the look
on your divine face...

you think you’re good and sweet
because you have no lust
because you fear and pray
but when you’re slowly dying
and just lying on your bed
did you really never want to
fuck the nights away?

obeying some laws most people won’t follow
you’re killing the joy you should be sucking
your crummy existence has to be hollow
do you think praying is more fun than fucking?

giving up
and living
giving up
and living
giving up faith
and living to the fullest

just stop the bullshit 
accept your nature
just stop your praying
accept the pleasure

you’re killing the joy 
you should be sucking
out of existence

praying is boring
fucking is fun
why the resistance?
why the resistance?!

use your existence!!!

praying gives you nothing
fucking gives you pleasure
why the resistance?
why the resistance?

use your existence
