Tearing down my own hills

the white coloured cotton cloud 
over the mountain starts to weep 
the tears roll down the empty hills 
water comes together in the wound 
which grows deeper by the moment... 

eventually the hills come down 
the rest is flushed out into the sea 
the cloud is laughing with pleasure 
as the hills will never grow again... 

new grass will grow on the ground 
where once the hills protected me...
