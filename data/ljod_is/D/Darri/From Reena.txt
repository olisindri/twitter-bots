From Reena

or darri, today

i can\'t remember that far
back into the past, can\'t

even remember 
if i imagined
him alive:

he taught me things
which made no difference
to me when i first heard
                      them

             like i was young
             and he was old; 
	     
	     older

and he taught me words
which made the day\'s shadows 
lengthen on the sidewalk
	         of my youth

	    words like
            i love you;
            
            i love you anyway

but i can\'t forget
the way i needed his touch
whether he really did exist

or not
