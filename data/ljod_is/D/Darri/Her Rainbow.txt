Her Rainbow

Like a rainbow after the rain,
With her shine no one could contain.
She gleamed brightly like the sun.
Never did she ask help from anyone.
She had more color than could be,
Now black swallows all sanity.
She had hidden sorrow in her heart,
With so much to break apart.
She left for a more peaceful place.
In our hearts she has a space.
When the darkness covers all light,
Pain makes a never-ending night.
Seems like the light will never return,
Like this feeling will always burn.
As when the clouds part after rain,
Only time can ease your pain.
The color will come back someday,
In your heart the rainbow will stay,
Her love will be with you forever,
To grow with and to treasure.
