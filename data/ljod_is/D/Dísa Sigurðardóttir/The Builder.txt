The Builder

And the sadness in their eyes
Haunted me down
Stopped me with their lies
And nailed me to the ground
Crossified me with their words 
And killed me with their hearts
Spit until it hurt 
Then got rid of those parts.

The parts of which I loved
The parts of wich I liked
Those parts were what I thought of
All those cold and lonely nights.
It’s easy for you to say
You’ve got everything you need
Could make it go away
But I can’t unless it bleeds.

Because the sadness in their eyes
It belonged to no one but me
And I’m the one that lies
Wish that you could see.
I’m bound to leave a mark
I’ve left to a place un known
After you had killed the spark
I had hardly built alone.
