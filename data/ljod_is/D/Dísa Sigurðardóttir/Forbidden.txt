Forbidden

Your hands are rusty nails
You eyes are iron suns
Your smile is others failure
And your love is forbidden

To feel pain forever
Is something I will do
Only yo see your face again
My mistakes can’t be forgotten

How to lie and cheat
And not recognize one self
Is something I have a degree in
Running away is my specialty

I don’t want to know she’s on you mind
When you hold me
And I don’t want to feel her perfume
On your neck and your clothing

Best friends don’t do that
It’s not right
I’m not yours
And your sertainly not mine.
