On the Other Side

Why do we fall, only to climb up again?
Why do we cry, only to be told to stop?
Why do people leave, when we love them so much?
This moonlight shines brighter then any other.
I’ll see you on the other side.

Your the moon,
I’m the stars,
And our love is the Aurora, Northern Lights.

On the other side, we’ll set the sun together.
On the other side, we’ll be alone forever.
‘Cause on the other side I’ll always hear you laughter.
On the other side, I remember your face.
