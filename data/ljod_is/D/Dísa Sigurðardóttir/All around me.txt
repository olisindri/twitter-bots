All around me

All around me
Little lies dying to be reavealed
Wishing for a master to keep them
And tell nobody

I’m surrounded by these lies
And they eat me up inside
Blaming me for their mistakes
Pushing me off my own edge

Slowly killing my decisions
And cutting my aching skin
I’m made of porculine
Don’t break me, I might scream
