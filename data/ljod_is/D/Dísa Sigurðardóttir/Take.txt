Take

It took some time to fall for you
It took some time to tell you too
It took a while for you to hurt me
But it took the longest to let go

It took a while to get over you
It took a while to shut the doors
It took some time to search for my self
But it took the longest to dry my tears

It took my courage to talk about it
It took my courage to smile through the lies
It took my pain to feel depressed
But it took it all to hear your news

It took my heart to get broken
It took my soul to fall
It took my eyes to hear those words spoken
But it will take more time to stop loving you
