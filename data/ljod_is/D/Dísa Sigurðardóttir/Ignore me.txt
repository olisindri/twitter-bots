Ignore me

What does it mean when I tell you to go?
Do you take it as if you can to anything
Are you god in your mind?
What happens if I die tonight?

With my blood I write my will.
And my tears make such good fabric
For the inside of my coffin
Lock me inside a box, and I will drain you.

I am the mirror of a monsters fantasy
And Iâ€™m waiting for you knife to kill me
Will I be depressed again?
Will I be nobody again?

If that happens
Would you be so kind to ignore me?
For old time sake.
Can you hear me now?
