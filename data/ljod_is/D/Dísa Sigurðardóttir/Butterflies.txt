Butterflies

I’ve got butterflies
Little butterflies
Flying around, all around
And your face keeps popping up
In my head, my flying head.

Bought a guitar
And a microphone
So I could sing you
This little song
And fly with you
Up to the sky
Take your hand
And go up high

Drink away
All doubts and fears
And fix our hearts
With magic tears
Hide away
All of my pain
And kiss your lips
In the poring rain

I’ve got a smile
A smile upon my face
Because of something, something new
And I can’t take away my hand
It’s holding so tight, on to you.
