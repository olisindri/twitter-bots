Heaven awaites you

It’s hard enough to let you go
But do we have to fight?
In this world I’m too alone
Too scared to sleep at night. 

Heaven awaites you
Don’t you know
Love is a river, dying to float
But when it breakes 
You’ve got nothing left
The love which had helped you
Is now burned up in flames. 

I’m helpless in a world that’s cold
I’m broken, I have nothing left
When you helt me I felt alive
Love is gone, one dreadful theft.
