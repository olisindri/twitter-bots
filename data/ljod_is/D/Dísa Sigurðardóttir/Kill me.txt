Kill me

Can’t stop thinking
Wishing, wanting, needing
Longing to hold my breath
While you kill me

Feel you taking charge
A power strong enough to lead an army
A power strong enough to sufficate me
Bruised and beaten wanting to die

Everything inside telling me to let go
Like it’s not my choice to live
Do I want this?
Is this what all of them want?

I must be the chosen one
Must be the weakest one
Must be unwanted
Unsatisfying

Shut my eyes,
Wishing, telling lies
Break my heart into pieces
Kill me, whilst I’m blind
