In a place so far away

In a place so far away
With deep eyes on display
This area of all unloved
Is a place for a head so soft
Tears will dry
Angels will cry
And the darkness will lead the way.

Go ahead to paradise
Telling twisted lies
Made of stone
All alone
In a place of all unknown.

Kisses of thy death
Bruises from thy life
A kiss goodbye
Just saying hi
In a place so far away
