How

How do you make me smile
And cry, all at the same time?
How do you make me live
And die, all at the same time?

I make little hearts with straps in the middle
With my tears I dry the fabric
And with my blood I clean the paper
I make little stars with straps around the corners.

How do you birth me
And kill me, all at the same time?
How do you empty me
And fill me, all at the same time?

I want to know how you make my tears run 
And how they heal every wound
Every bruise, every mark
How do you take away my scars and twist them around?

Everytime I look into your eyes
I die a little inside my soul
Everytime you stand beside me
I cry a little inside my heart
Everytime I crawl beneath your skin
I fade a little inside of me
And everytime you lie to me
I lie a little to myself.
