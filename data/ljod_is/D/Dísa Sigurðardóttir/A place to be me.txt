A place to be me

I’ve been searching for answers
But all I’ve found are questions.
Questions about this life,
Which has left me stranded
Hating myself

And when I look into that broken mirror
All I see is your bitter face
Screaming at me, yelling
I should find my own place
Who are you to judge me?

I look away
Trying to forget our names
These names are just random
Sitting beside us, 
making us someone we’re not

I’m not a liar
But I’m not that honest.
I am not a cheater
Although I sometimes decieve
I do not hate
But I don’t love that strongly either.

If it makes me bitter 
To have trouble finding my own excistance
I wouldn’t know if this is
The best place to be me

A place to not be
