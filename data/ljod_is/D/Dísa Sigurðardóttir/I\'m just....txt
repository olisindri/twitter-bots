I\'m just...

I’m just waiting
Just awaiting
Waiting for something 
That never comes

I’m just wishing
Just wishing away
Wishing for someone
That does not excist

I’ve been looking
Just looking around
Looking for somebody
That loves me for a while.

I’m just longing
Just desperately longing
Longing for some way
That saves me from myself.
