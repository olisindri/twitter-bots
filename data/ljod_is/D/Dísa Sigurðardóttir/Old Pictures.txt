Old Pictures

Took a look at old pictures

And remembered old times

 
Found my favourite neckless

Been carrying it ever since

 
Saw someone just like you, today

Could have sworen it was you

But he didnâ€™t have the same blink

As those overdozed eyes

 
You were always the first one

The best one, the worst one


The one that disappeared.
