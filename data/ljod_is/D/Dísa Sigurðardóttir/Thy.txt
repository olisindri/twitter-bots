Thy

Thy heart will be my shelter
Thy head will be my home
Thy eyes will be my secret
Thy lips will be my own

I will die for thy honor
I will break for thy voice
I will kill with thy heart
I will kill for thy kiss.

For I will do all I can do
I will tell all I can tell
With thy kiss, upon my lips.
I die.*
