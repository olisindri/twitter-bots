Girl with the Golden Locks

In a little place unknown
she tries to find her home
so cold, depressed
they couldn\'t care less
for the girl with the golden locks.

In trailer park far away
she doesn\'t want to stay
if he leaves her now
she won\'t know how
to look for life again.

In my coldest dream I\'ve dreamt
I saw her standing there
her tear on her cheek
her lips were cealed
and I never saw her again.
