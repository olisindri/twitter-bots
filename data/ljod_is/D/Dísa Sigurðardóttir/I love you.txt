I love you

I still feel your breath on my neck
Your touch in the dark
And those eyes of yours are still staring at me
Those blue eyes of honesty and passion

 And when my world feels like it’s falling apart
You pick me up and give me all you’ve got
Let me love you endlessly
I wish I could tell you that

I love the way you make me laugh
I hate it when you cry
I love it when you hold my hand
And tell me I can fly

This is the way my life should be
Loving you forever
I wish you were here, so I could tell you
How I feel inside

But I know you know I loved you
I just never told you it’s true
That my heart belongs to noone
Exept for you
