Silver and Wine

Don’t be afraid, my friend
I am here until, the end of all time
I will grant you, your every wish
And hold all your worries,
Through silver and wine.

When your tears are tearing you down
When darkness falls all around
And everything seems oh,so, wrong
I will be there to hold your hand
I will be there to help you stand.

And when it’s time to say goodbye
Stars up above and high
They will help us not to part
And I will hold all your worries
Through silver and wine.
