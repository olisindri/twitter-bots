Stay Quiet with me

How do I tell what I’m trying to say
I’m trying to find words
That’ll explain what I’m feeling

I’m not jealous but I’m bitter
I’m not angry but I’m sad
I ain’t crying but there are tears in my eyes
And my mind’s not alone but it’s lonely

If I tell it straight out you will hate me
If I say what I mean you’ll ignore me
If I look in your eyes you won’t adore me
If that’s all I can do, you will never hold me

When she comes to you again
And holds your hand
When she loves you forever
And kisses your lips
My life will be over, darling

That smile is killing me slowly
Take my pain away, don’t increase it
Can you just be here for a while
And stay quiet with me
