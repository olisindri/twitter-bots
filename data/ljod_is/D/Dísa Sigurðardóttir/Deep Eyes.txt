Deep Eyes

You have eyes of decivement
And lips of lies
Your soul is as cold as the atlantic
And your heart’s made of stone
You lie and you fake things
You pretend to be so much more
Your lips are linger as thiefs
And your eyes are full of sorrow

You hurt me but I stay
You lie still here I lay
I cry over your mistakes
Your fears are my laughter
Your words are my screams
And your sorrows are my tears
‘Cause every night you scream
My tears are wasted by one more meter

But still 
Never the less
And even though
I still love you
I still hate you
I still need you
And I still tear your picture to pieces
My tears have fallen for too many days
And I have forgiven you everything you’ve done
For I am weak and you have got a hold of me
And you have eyes of kindness 
And a mind of loneliness
I forgive you
