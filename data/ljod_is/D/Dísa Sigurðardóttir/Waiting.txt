Waiting

Underneath my aching skin
I’m not sleeping in anymore
My mind is open to your thoughts
Tell me what you think

I wish there was a place for my head
If there is I won’t find it here
And when this darkness opens my eyes
You’ll be gone, and I won’t find you
Waiting

My fingers touch the bottom of my glass
And your eyes, are looking trough me
Will you comment on my thoughts?
Don’t you care, I won’t keep you
Waiting

Are you still waiting?
