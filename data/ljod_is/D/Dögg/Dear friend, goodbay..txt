Dear friend, goodbay.

I have no feelings,
I have no tears,
I have no love,
I have no fears.

I have to leave,
Cuz I love him so,
You must belive,
But I have to go.

I’ll miss you,
I really will,
Hope you love me to,
But I can’t stay still.

Just cry a little,
Cuz I loved you so.
Don’t hate my soul,
Cuz she had to go.
