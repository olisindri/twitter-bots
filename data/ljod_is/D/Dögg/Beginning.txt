Beginning

I never thought it would come to this,
With pain in my heart
I cut my wrist.

Saying goodbay to everyone I love,
Saying goodbay to everything I have,
Saying goodbay to long lost times.
Saying hello to freedome.

Last thought I thought of you,
Your long hair and pretty eyes.
I love you so.
I die, my sould dies.

There is no turning back,
Not that I wanâ€™t to,
A last goobay would have been nice,
But there is nothing to do.

As I feel my life drift away.
I still think of you,
Last thing I have to say.
I love you so, hope you love me to.
