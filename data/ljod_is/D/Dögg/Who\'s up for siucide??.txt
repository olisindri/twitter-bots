Who\'s up for siucide??

I belive in you,
When you need me to.
If you call my name,
I’ll be there.
Dead or alive.

Your my star in the sky,
The blood in my heart.
You lift me up so I can fly,
You pull me down when I need to cry.

I want to die.
There is no right,
There is no wrong.
My body remanes,
But my soul is gone.

To you my friend
I say goodbay,
Cut my wrist,
Wanting to die

I loved you so
And I always will.
I had to go
But I need you still.

Don’t cry for me,
Just be glad,
My soul is free.
I’m holding my dad.

My best friend I love you so,
To bad I had to go.
It’s just so hard to say goodbay,
Don’t cry, stay strong and try.
