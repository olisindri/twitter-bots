Never Again

Watches me like an angel
Holds my hand when i need
For him i thank all
Good from heaven or an evil seed.

Heâ€™s the one i always loved
Loved him so my heart broke
Killed him self
Said goodbay and my heart stroke.

Falling to pieces
He just walked away
Thought everything would be alright
Remeber it like it was yesterday

Wish you where here
So i could kick your ass
Kiss your cheek
And tell you that i love you dad.

I coming soon
To be with you
You love the most
And i know you love me to.
