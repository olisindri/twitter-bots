The Jungle

The animals wait for you
the girls scream.
All has fallen apart.
Boys are getting dressed in the locker-room
and the parents are making sweet love in the jungle.
Monkey\'s scream.
Wake up,
wake up from your sleep,
deep sleep.
The lions have captured Mrs. Nany,
there is no one who can watch me now.
The girls scream again.

The father is dead
fallen into the shaddow.
Woman of fire has taken him
she want\'s him to cook for her.

The girls are afraid,
all but one,
she\'s inlove and know\'s she can\'t go higher. 
The man she loves is violent.
He loves another.
That\'s why she screams.
The rain falls on my head,
I have no hair today.
Love all, serve all they sing.
That guy sleeps with men, he\'s gay.
