...all I can do...

When is the world to perfict?
When can I stop these endless thinking?
My mind is pure,
but is your?
How will we know,
what to do?
When do we go,
and where to??

Do we all have to be inlove?
where do feelings end?
What kind of feeling can take us into space?
and where do we land??

You might think I\'m stupid
Like lennon said,
I\'m not the only one
No I will go to bed.
And hope that I will be gone.
I will try to do what I\'m told
but inside all I don\'t want to
I just want to be bold
...all I can do...
