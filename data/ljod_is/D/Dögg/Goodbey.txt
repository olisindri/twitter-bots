Goodbey

I know that if you walk away
you turn around and go
leave me behinde with nothing or noone
I will miss you so

I wish that it could be a little longer
be a little more
It could have been good or greate
but what was it for?

I love you a little and little bit more
your hands, your body, your smile and eyes
I liked you every day every night
Why do we have to do the goodbey\'s??
