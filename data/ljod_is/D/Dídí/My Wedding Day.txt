My Wedding Day

I woke up this morning with a frown on my face,
(today is the day)
The morning was bright, the birds sang a song,
(today is the day)
I felt like a ton was lying on my chest,
(today is the day)
But still I got up, how could I rest,
(today is the day)

Today is the day, the dreadful day, the day that has gloomed like a hawk over pray.





I woke up this morning with a smile on my face,
(today is the day)
The wind was blowing, the cold cut through bones,
(today is the day)
I felt like a feather, ready to fly,
(today is the day)
I jumped out of bed, how could I rest,
(today is the day)

Today is the day, the wonderful day, the day that has lingered like the sunshines ray
