Manon

Manon whispers to me while I sleep.
Soft voice...kind voice.
The sort of voice that makes you listen even thouf you don´t want to.

He asks me:
"Who painted your heart black..who made it stop beating?
Who took away your abilty to love and trust another human-being?"

"You, like all that breathes, you are my child.
With all my heart and all my soul I love you all.

"And now..from this day forward..I´m going to heal you. I´m going to take the darkness away..and give you strength.

"It wont happen straigt away..but I will succeed..for I am Manon...
The God of all that breathes.
And I love you"
