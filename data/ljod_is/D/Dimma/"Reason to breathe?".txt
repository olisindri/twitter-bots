"Reason to breathe?"

Searching for something...you call it soul..
How can one be so empty..?

Days go by, they're all the same..(someone show me the path that's mine.)

Remember the butterfly that lived in my soul? It flew away..it's gone...my soul doesn't breath anymore.

I know that what I'm doing is wrong...(but the days pass more quickly.)
That's what I need...my sanity is all I have left...(or is it?) and I can't afford to loose that too..

All my masks...You never know where you have me...(neither do I...)

Once I found a butterfly in my pocket...
I should hav made a wish...but I didn't.

Am I doomed forever..? Or can this breathless soul come to life again?
