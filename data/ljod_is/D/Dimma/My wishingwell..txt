My wishingwell.

I found a wishingwell
and I made a wish.
Time went by and my wish came true.

For a while life was wonderful, so I thougt -my sick mind told me so.

But I was living in a lie.
Lies I told myself,
lies wich to me were told.

And all those lies I believed.

But the time came, and I broke down the well before I would drown in all those lies.

And now I have learned to never to make a wish...

they might all come true....
