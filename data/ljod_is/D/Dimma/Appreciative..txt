Appreciative.

In the palm of my hand you are...white, round - beautiful. I close my eyes..wish you had aroma...

With my eyes closed..I can feel you as you run down my throat..now everything is going to get better.

I feel you in my blood..in my vains..
I feel it when you stop the nonsence in my head...so grateful.

Now I´m not scared anymore...
you help me ease the pain..so grateful.
My head doesn´t scare me anymore, not for now atleast...and I´m grateful.

Like the Master said:
"I have become comfortably numb"

And I´m grateful....
