Locked inside

My tears are streaming
I can’t get out

My mind is screaming
Stop this PLEASE

My head is spinning
I can’t breath

Why are you doing this
Why?

I want to sleep
I want to stop this

But I can’t get out
I’m locked inside

With no one who can help me
No one who understands me

But whose fault is that?
No ones but mine…
