Mystery

There are all kinds of mysteries
mystery of people
mystery of life
mystery of humankind
and mystery of the mind

The mystery of my mind
has never been encrypted
it's like an enigma
sometimes I don't know what I'm doing
or what I should do

Does anyone really know
isn't everyone's mind a mystery
is there someone who always 
knows what to do or
what he or she is doing

I don't think so
everyone has there mystery
some mysteries are greater than others
some are lighter
you can understand some mysteries
and other you can't

But remember everyone 
has it's own mystery
everyone can be confused
by something

You are not ALONE
