Fly Away

Can I fly away from this world?
And be free,
Free at last
With no worries
No darkness
Only daylight 
And happiness 
forever 

Oh how that would be wonderful
To be free
Not to worry
Just be happy
With only few setbacks
But not too much
Not so much that it suffocates you 

Can that be done?
Can you make me fly?
O heavenly Father
I ask for your help 

I’m not asking for too much
Just some peace
To live my life 
To the fullest
No darkness
Only daylight
And happiness
forever 

Can that be done?
Can you make me fly?
O heavenly Father
I ask for your help  

Set me free
