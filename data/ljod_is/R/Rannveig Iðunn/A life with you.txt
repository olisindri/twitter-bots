A life with you

There was a time, I felt good,
I was happy
Everything was so beautiful and nice
People liked me
I liked me
I was free, I was innocent
I was a little girl

But then they came, and made me feel the way I did
They destroyed this part of my life,
I didn’t like me,
I thought nobody did
But I was wrong

You came
You came and helped me up
You told me that I was beautiful,
And I deserved to live my life
The way every woman dose
You are the one,
The one I want to spend my whole life with
I want to hold you
I want to kiss you,
I want your love everyday
I love you

Because, there was a time
I felt good
I was happy
Everything was so beautiful and nice
People liked me, I liked me
I was free, I was innocent
I was a little girl

Now I feel the same way
As I did when I was
A little girl
I am happy, I am free
All because of you
‘coz I’m with you
And you’re with me
And we’re in love

Don’t lose hope what happened to me can happen to you too, just wait…..love will conquer all!
