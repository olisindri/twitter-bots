Alone

In a world there’s full of sorrow
I live in fear
With little security but some love
I don’t know what to say
So I try to say as little as I can

Some people know me 
Some don’t 
Some want to know me
Some don’t
That’s life
Not just my life
But everyone’s

I’m not that special
I guess I’m just like everyone else
Well almost

I feel like I‘m alone 
But still I have lots of friends
Lots of people who care for me
But why do I feel so alone?
Why do I feel empty?
Tired
So tired

I want joy
I want to be happy
I want to feel safe
I want to feel love

I want peace!
