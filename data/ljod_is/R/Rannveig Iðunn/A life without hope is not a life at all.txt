A life without hope is not a life at all

I feel so empty
have nothing to say
why can't I do this and that
like the rest of the girls?
always hoping
always praying
but nothing happens
nothing at all
can't you help me?
can't I help me?
is something wrong with this life
or is it me?
I'm not sure 
why don't you tell me
make me feel good
make me feel secure
all I need is love and caring
all I need is hope
can I get that
or is everything lost?
