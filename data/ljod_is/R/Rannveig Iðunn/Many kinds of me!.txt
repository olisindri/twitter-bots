Many kinds of me!

I can be a mouse
Afraid of everything

I can be a bear
Hugging everyone

I can be a cat
Loving to everyone

I can be a dog 
Loyal to friends

I can be a mole
Sour and annoyed

I can be a lot of things
But it’s all me
You have to accept me for who I am
Or not accept me at all
