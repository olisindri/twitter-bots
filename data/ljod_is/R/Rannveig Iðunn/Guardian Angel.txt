Guardian Angel

My guardian angel
come and take me away
show me what to live for
and guide me to the light
so that the light
can lead me out of this darkness

Teach me how to wake up each morning 
and be thankful
be thankful for my family and friends
and most importantly my life
teach me to be satisfied with what I got
and teach me to be happy

Show me what I got
and what I can do 
show me my talents
and how to use them for good

Don’t let me waste my life
doing absolutely nothing

Dry my tears and show me the light
give me the strength to move on
and to deal with this life
