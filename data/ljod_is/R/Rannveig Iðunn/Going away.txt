Going away

You’re so kind to me
Why are you kind to me?
I miss you when you’re not here
I don’t laugh as much
Don’t smile as much
I look forward to seeing you
But now you’re going away
And I won’t see you as much
It will not be as fun being here
Who will make fun of me,
Or take care of me?
Who will keep me happy,
Or ask me if I’m ok?
Who will take your place?
Thank God you’re not going to far away
I will see you
But not as much
But it’s ok
We’re still friends
We can still talk
I wish you good luck
And get on with my life.
