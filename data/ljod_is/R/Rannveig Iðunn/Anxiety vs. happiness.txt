Anxiety vs. happiness

Anxiety, anxiety
oh how I love my anxiety
how it turns my stomach upside down
and makes me crawl under my sheets in my bed
how it makes me over-think everything
and stops me from doing a lot of stuff

Happiness, happiness
now what is that?
Why should I want to be happy?
Nothing excited about that
I don’t want any butterflies in my stomach
and be able to do anything I set my mind to

Why should I want to live carefree 
when misery is so interesting?
