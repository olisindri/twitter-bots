My imaginary world

My imaginary world

My world is full of imagination
My world is perfect

In my world I’m always happy
I’m not worried or stressed out
I’m carefree

I feel love all around me
I have reason to exist

I sing to everyone
And let them experience joy with me
They like it

I expose myself
I’m vulnerable
But they like it

They like me
They respect me
They are proud of me

But that’s not the real world
The real world is darker
It’s not as joyful

It’s all in my imagination
But I have to believe
Believe that it will come true
