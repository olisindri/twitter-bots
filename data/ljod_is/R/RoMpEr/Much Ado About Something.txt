Much Ado About Something

Much Ado About Something

"No, the world must be peopled!"
Those are the words
from the lips 
of a man
by the name of Benedick from Padua.

I think he does not 
understand the perturbation
of human sanctuary
by speaking them
and believing in them.

For the people speak poniards
towards true scholars,
conjure up massive wepons
to destroy each other and
are close to infecting the north star.

People have transgressed, lied 
and denied universal wisdom.
They are only blocks of life
with nothing inside.

But they are tolerated 
\\\"for a man is a giddy thing...\\\"
