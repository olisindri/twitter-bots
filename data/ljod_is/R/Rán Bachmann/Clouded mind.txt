Clouded mind

Clouded mind of sorrow
no reason for happy thoughts.
But try to pull you self together
Leave the sorrow let it go,
hear our call your not alone.
Join the army of broken trust
and fight the battel
we where used to lose.
Now we are stronger, now we win
this battel is forever
so lets stay strong.
