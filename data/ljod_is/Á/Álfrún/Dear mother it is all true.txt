Dear mother it is all true

You are my one and only mother
and no matter what happends
you will always be my loving mother
and nobody can change the facts.

You are my best and greatest teacher
that I can count on and believe forever
and I know that you will always be there
when ever I need you, no matter of time.

The times comes when I almost hate you
but the times when I love you are stronger
because I know that I have no reason not too
and I know that you will love me whatever.

I guess what IÂ´m trying to say dear mother
that I will always deeply love you forever
and what ever happends in the coming future
you can always believe that my love to you is true.
