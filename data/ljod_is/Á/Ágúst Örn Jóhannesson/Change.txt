Change

Sitting alone,
forgotten,
left behind,
my dreams are like ruins
a  yesterday gone by.
The once powerfull
river of emotions
now frozen, cold and dead.

I try to brake it,
crack it,
defrost it.
Nothing!
Desolate isolation
intense despair.

Bright light
raging heat
playfulness
joy and laughter
temperature rising
starstruck eyes
the earth awakens

My glacier
crying,
shaking.
Breath of life
roaring thunder
a flowering rose

Birds flying
singing
IÂ´m crying.
Shackles of old
gone
no more cold

Frost retreating
streams are forming
runing gently
in a single path
power building
earth erupting
volcano showing

rainbow and butterflies
the song of whales
sweet sound of water
walls crumbling down
The sun rising
everything awakes

I smile
I laugh
having fun
the world is different
brighter
more colourful
feeling lighter
can I fly?

I stand up
flap my wings
and slowly
very slowly
I rise above the ground
climbing ever so slowly
towards my sun
towards my lifegiver
towards happiness
towards you?
