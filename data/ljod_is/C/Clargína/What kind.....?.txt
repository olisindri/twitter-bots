What kind.....?

What kind of love is it,
if you have to pay for it in tears?
What kind of hate is it,
if you embrace it with your heart?
What kind of respect is it,
if you get hated in return?
What kind of fear is it,
if it makes you laugh?
-What kind of life is it,
if you donÂ´t get to live it?
