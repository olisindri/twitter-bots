My lonely soul

Where the sun never shines,
where love is never felt,
where lonelyness is only known,
where the darkness covers all,
where a tiny voice calls out:
HELP ME!

Where the walls are made of me,
black, rocky, harsh and steep.
Where no one can enter, but me...

That place is my soul,
where all feelings are combined
into little flames,
that unite in an ocean of fire,
burning me inside,
happy for my sufforing...

Those flames are my doing,
but to conquer them, I must fight.

That I can begin with looking into a child´s eye,
and realize that I´m not the only one,
not understanding the world.

-I´m not alone....!
