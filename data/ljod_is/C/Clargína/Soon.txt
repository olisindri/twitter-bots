Soon

I haven´t felt alive in years.
My head is empty,
as well as my heart.
I see my life go by,
without feeling it...
-I just know!

Feeling all dead inside,
makes me wonder...
-Wonder if Death is coming
to claim my life,
with a grin on it´s face.

Will I die soon???
-May I PLEASE!

Lurking around in my mind,
I still feel it,
-I still smell it.

My brain will soon stop functioning
My heart will soon stop beating,
My last breath will soon
be taken,
maybe not today,
-But soooooon!
