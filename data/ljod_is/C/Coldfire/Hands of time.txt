Hands of time

When the hands of time move fast,
And you can't erase the past,
Then close your eyes and you will see,
Come and take my hand,
And follow me to the promise land,
Hold me close inside your heart,
Let us never fall apart,
A love that lasts eternally,
That's the ocean of eternity.
