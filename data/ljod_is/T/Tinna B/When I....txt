When I...

When I wake up...
When I am eating my breakfast...
When I am siting in scholl and learn...
When I am with me friends...
When I am geting high...
When I am eating my dinner...
When I am trying to fall asleep...
Then all I can think about is...
killing myself...
go to a better place...
there everything is so beautiful...
no murder...
no fright...
no cruelty...
just high spirits...
When I get there I will tell you about it...
all the beauty...
If you want...
you can come with me...
See your future...
see your assignment...
see your reason...
see you purpose on the earth...
I will let you know when I get there...
there will be soon...
