Intergalactic plans of a balastic missile

In the blue clouded sky, I fly.
Why? Cause a man pushed the red button.
I see life Im not willing to destroy.
I fly over Retton, over farmer Roy.

Im getting hotter my thrusters burn.
Im made of steel but heart is in a turn.
I wanna go back but my program says no.
Feel as time stands still, all so slow.

Now I peak down, all I see is snow.
May be over Russia, think Im gonna blow.
My eyes are getting tired, Im asleep
I kill 1.000 people, not what I need.
