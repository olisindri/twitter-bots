My life...

My life is like a wildwood...
no happiness...
no people...
no life...
just woe and unhappiness...
If I walk a while,  I am lost...
I can´t find any people to help me...
I can´t find any track...
I can´t find any way to go back...
I can´t find any way to live this life....

My life is like a sad story...
A litlle girl is try to survive...
She is alone outside trying to warm up with her matchsticks...
She dream about the rich people...
How it is to be rich...
and can do everything...
To be inside and sit by with the fireplace...
But her life is not so easy...
Her life is so difficult...
though she is just a litlle girl...
This girl is me...
This litlle girl wiht painfull past is me...

Sometimes I can´t stand up...
When I lie down the floor...
I start scream...
I start shake...
And a feel like there is someone behind me...
He is steping in my back with knif...
He steping and steping...
and I screaming and screaming...
I can hear him say...
Give me alchohol...
Give me drugs...
I start to screaming higher...
and shake faster...
I scream.... 
 No, Leave My Alone!
finally I fall in revere...
When I wake up...
with syringe in my hand... 

You think that your life is terrible...
but my life is most terrible than yours...
Envision your life as ten times more painfull.
You have envisioned my life...
If you envisioned your life is one thousand times more painfull.
Then you have envisioned my past...
Don´t say that yours life is terribly...
´cause my life is more terrible then yours...
