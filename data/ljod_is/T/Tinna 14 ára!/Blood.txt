Blood

I don’t know why.... 
but I love blood... 
I love watching it run down my hand... 
and come alive... 
I love the way it makes me feel... 
strong. 
Coz I am strong... 
I don’t cry...
I’ll never cry again... 
the blood is my cry... 
the blood drops are my tears... 
red tears... 

It’s all your fault... 
you make me cut... 
every time you hurt me... 
you get a few cuts... 
every single cut on my hand has an assignment... 
a name... 
a purpose... 
a reason... 
sometimes it’s you... 
sometimes it’s just life… 
I don’t know why... 
but it helps me survive... 

Most the time I’m just in my room... 
I love my room... 
that’s where my knife lives... 
he has his special place... 
he’s my best friend...
he’ll never leave me…
he’ll never let me down…
you let me down.
that’s why I don’t trust you…
you failed…
you hurt me…
I hate you…
my knife hates you to…
that’s why he’s my friend…

Why…
why do you do this…
why do you hurt me…
I never hurt you…
I’d never hurt you…
my knife might….
but not me…
I swear…
well no I don’t…
but I’ll try my best... 
not to kill you…
even if you killed me…
inside…
you killed my heart…
you killed me.

I don’t sleep…
I hate sleeping…
I hate trying to fall asleep…
Then I have to think…
And all I can think of…
Is you…
You…
That’s why I don’t sleep…
That’s why I cant sleep…
That’s why I wont sleep…
It’s all your fault…
My whole life’s your fault…
