The Love

I can give you my other eye...
Just so I can be sure a you will never leave me...
I can give you my heart...
Just so I can be sure you will always be with me...
I´ve kissed the moon a million times...
I´ve danced with angels in the sky...
I´ve seen snowfall in the summertime...
I´ve seen the world from the highest mountain...
I´ve even seen miracles...
I´ve seen the sun make love to the sea...
But I haven´t still seen anything...
That amazes me quite like you do...
