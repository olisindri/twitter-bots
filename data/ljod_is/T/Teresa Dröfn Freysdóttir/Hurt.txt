Hurt

Your face is like a razor to my heart 
Your voice killing me inside 
Am I invisable? 
Don\'t you see me? 
Why won\'t you talk to me? 

You act like I don\'t excist 
Ignore my feelings 

Am I just another girl 
fallen for your lies? 
Am I just another girl 
stuck in your gracious gaze? 

Your face is like a razor to my heart 
tearing it apart 
A cut so deep will never fade 

Your voice killing me inside 
I can feel myself twist in agony inside 

I just wanna try again 
See what happens 
We are older now, wiser and better 
Maybe it would work, maybe not 
but then I\'d know 

STOP KILLING ME! 
IT HURTS SO MUCH! 
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN\'T HURT ME NO MORE! 
YET I\'VE BEEN HURTING ALL THIS TIME! 
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS! 
STOP!
