Picture my suicide

I\'m gonna draw a picture in my wrist today 
I got no pencil but I\'ve got this razorblade. 
I\'ll stick it in to see how far it goes, 
and cut my life away cut me loose from this hook 
I\'ve been hanging on so long. 

And when I\'m lying cold, dead on the floor 
Don\'t you cry for me 
this is what I wanted 
You cannot feel my pain, 
you cannot see it either 
but I cannot live with that pain 
try to understand. 

Keep on living your perfect lives 
like I know you can 
My life was never meant to be but don\'t forget 
I love you all with my heart 
and that\'s why I\'m gone 

I\'m gonna draw a picture in my wrist today 
I got no pencil but I\'ve got this razorblade 
Stuck it too deep and the ambulance was late again
