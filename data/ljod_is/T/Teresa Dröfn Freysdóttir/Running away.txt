Running away

Running away, away from life 
don\'t know where I\'m runing 
I just gotta get away 
My heart is pounding 
don\'t know what I did 
what was I thinking? 
I just gotta get away. 

Never ever look back 
keep on running fast. 
Never ever think back 
this is now the past. 
Never ever stop 
keep on going on 
and on and on and on. 

Wonder about the future 
what will it bring? 
money food and drinking or will I be a dope? 
House, kids and marrige or will I be a bum? 
I don\'t really care 
I just gotta get away 

Never ever look back 
keep on running fast. 
Never ever think back 
this is now the past. 
Never ever stop 
keep on going on 
and on and on and on. 

Now I see a light 
not so far from here. 
Is it what I think: 
The final task. 
My burden was heavy 
now it has lightened 
cuz you came down here 
and saved me.
