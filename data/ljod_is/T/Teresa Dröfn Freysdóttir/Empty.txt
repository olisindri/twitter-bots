Empty

Do you ever get the feeling about a person that you used to care so much about... and still care about
But you feel denied? 
You can\'t bare to see the person again? 
Because the person hurt your feelings? 
But you care so much about the person? 
Ever feel the urge to meet that person? 
Even after all the person did? 
Just to see if the person is doing fine? 
Even thouh you know 
The moment you see this person 
You\'ll burst into tears

I feel so empty inside
