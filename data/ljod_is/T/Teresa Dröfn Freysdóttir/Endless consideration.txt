Endless consideration

The fire I see sparkles in my eyes 
I don\'t know why I\'m here in the darkness 
Cuz ever since you left I\'ve been feeling this way 
and it wakes up my mind to my old considerations 
So I sit here in the dark 
All alone 
without you thinking how can I get you back. 
And it brings me back, brings me back to my endless consideration 

If I should die tonight, would you cry? 
If I should take my life, would you regret leaving? 
If I shouyld die tonight, would you miss me at all? 

It\'s been a long time and I\'m still crying 
and I wonder now do you even miss me. 
Without you I feel so ugly, oh no, 
my self-esteem is breaking in front of you 
The very sight of you breaks me down, 
the sound of your voice makes me cry and I wanna die. 
Because I\'m without you and I\'ll never get you back. 
And it brings me back, brings me back to my endless consideration. 

If I should die tonight, would you cry? 
If I should take my life, would you regret leaving? 
If I should die tonight, would you miss me at all? 

Please just look at me, 
can\'t you see my pain? 
Just look at me without you, 
my world crumbles. 
Everything goes wrong when I\'m without you. 
Can\'t you see I just wanna have you back? 
And it brings me back, brings me back to my endless consideration. 

If I should die tonight, would you cry? 
If I should take my life, would you regret leaving? 
If I should die tonight, would you miss me at all? 
Would you miss me at all? 
Would you miss me at all? 
Would you miss me at all?
