Catch me

I\'m falling so fast through this abyss 
I know the landing will kill me 
Please won\'t somebody grab me? 
Save me? 

Soft, strong arms catch me 
I\'m saved 
I look at my saviour 
It\'s you 
We share a long deep kiss 
happiness? 

Happiness isn\'t present in this world 
just as I started feeling happy 
I opened my eyes 
I saw I was lying all alone in my dark room 

And realized that it was just a dream 
nothing more... 
Does happiness even excist? 
Because I know from my own experience that it\'s never permanent 
It allways fades away and leaves you in darkness 

That\'s when the hopelessness, lonelyness, sadness 
reality hits you. 

I wish it wasn\'t a dream 
I wish it was actually reality. 

Maybe this is a dream, this sad place 
and the vision in my dream is actually the real reality? 

I wish...
