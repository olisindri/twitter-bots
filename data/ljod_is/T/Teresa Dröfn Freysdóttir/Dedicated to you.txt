Dedicated to you

I\'d never think you\'d do this 
I\'d never think you\'d betray me like this 
What was wrong? 
Was it something I said, something I did? 
Am I too ugly, am I too fat? 
We had so much in common 
What did she have that I didn\'t have? 
What did she show that I didn\'t show? 
Please tell me it\'s not true 
Please tell me it\'s a lie 
I never told you this, I loved you 
Would it had made any difference if I had? 
This has ruined me completely 
I got sad, I got drunk and cryed 
all those tears I cryed were for you 
Each tear had a memory 
A figure of time we shared 
A fragment of my life 
You said you wouldn\'t hurt me no more 
You can\'t handle hurtnig me 
I can\'t handle to loose you 
although I already have 
I am nothing, I am already dead 
You killed me and yet 
I remain as dedicated to you as this song
