All alone

All alone in this world, 
nobody can save me. 
Sitting in a corner, curled, 
hiding nobody can see. 

I feel so confused I feel so amazed, 
is there really no other way out? 
Am I just this crazed? 
I\'m all alone in the crowd. 

Everything I enjoyed has flown away 
and I\'m here lonely 
can\'t take another day. 
Willing to dissapear only. 

My hands are cut and torn assunder 
don\'t you know I can hear what you\'re saying? 
Who else than me understands this blunder? 
I still have no wish for staying. 

Tears are leaking from my eyes. 
I know you\'re just using me. 
I can see through your lies, 
you just want a flagging I can see. 

I really don\'t wish to die, 
all the things that I\'d miss. 
Still it\'s time to say goodbye. 
It can\'t be different, it\'s like this.
