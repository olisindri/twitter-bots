Shattered

For all the people who suffer like I do 
abandoned by their love 
Their hopes and dreams shattered by denial 
Forced into the shadow of sadness 

Mother never cared, father gone away 
all alone loved by nobody 
Then you came along 
The only one who cared 
The only one that ever showed me love 

I loved you but you were afraid 
Afraid of being loved 
Afraid of being happy 
You sacrificed your true happiness for your own image of being happy 

And I suffer, cause I long for you 
Abandoned by you 
My hopes and dreams shattered by your greatness 
Forced to live in the shadow of sadness 

Drenched in my blood I lay 
And since I can\'t have your love 
I just want to let go 
Because I can\'t live without your touch 

So it\'s best for me to leave this world 
A world that doesn\'t love me 
A world that doesn\'t want me 
So really I should just let go but I wonder 
How will you react to the news of my death 
Will you even shed a tear? 
I can\'t go on 
Because I\'m shattered
