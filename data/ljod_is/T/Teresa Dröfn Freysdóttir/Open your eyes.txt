Open your eyes

Discover it 
Realize it 
Accept it 

Discover me 
Realize me 
Accept me 

Lying here this close to you 
Staring at your face 
Looking in your eyes 
Waiting for you to say it.... 
Say what we\'re both thinking 

My chest rises, hard to breathe 
Cuz you take my breath away 
Butterflies fluttering 
Body shaking, disire 

Your kiss so unique, so deep 
I\'m lost in your kiss 
trembling with desire and lust 
I desire you 

Your touch so gentle 
Your body so fragile 
But you are so cautious 
Are you afraid that I will hurt you? 
Betray you? 
Trust me! 

Your orgasmic piece 
fits right in my puzzle 
It\'s the missing piece I needed 
I want you 

This was one time 
I want it to last 
Open your eyes 
Lower your guard 
I won\'t hurt you 

Discover it 
Realize it 
Accept it 

Discover me 
Realive me 
Accept me 

Discover love 
Realize love 
Accept love 

I wanna give it to you
