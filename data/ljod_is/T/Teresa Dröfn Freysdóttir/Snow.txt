Snow

Snow falling on my face 
snow everywhere, snow. 
It\'s dark and I\'m alone outside 
snow eveywhere, snow. 

Have you ever had a mother who doesn\'t give a shit? 
Have you ever had a father that doesn\'t give a damn? 
Have you ever had a family who doesn\'t care? 
Have you ever spent one moment in my shoes? 
Then why do you judge me as you do? 

I look around, 
everywhere broken glass 
I don\'t know waht happened. 
I don\'t know who the fuck I am and they come. 

Now I\'m locked inside of here 
white walls everywhere 
don\'t go, don\'t go 
I\'m locked inside the darkness in your heart. 

Mother I just wanted you to love me 
Father I just wanted you to know me 
Family I just wanted understanding 
You, I just wanted to be loved. 

Have you ever had to wake up early in the mornig, 
ignore your drugged up mother in the kitchen? 
Take your little brother to kindergarden and getting him back? 
Just like you were his mom? 
Because his mom isn\'t here anymore... 
She is somewhere, lost in her head? 
Have you ever stood alone on your two feet? 
With a baby that you gotta feed? 
Had no friend cuz you had responability? 
Is is right for a 10 year old kid? 
HAve you ever spent one moment in my shoes? 
Then why do you judge me as you do? 

Snow falling on my face, 
snow everywhere, snow. 
It\'s dark and I\'m leading you home, 
mother please wake up.
