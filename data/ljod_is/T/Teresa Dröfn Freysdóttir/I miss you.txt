I miss you

From the wounds that you left me 
floats my decay 
You left me bleeding 
life fading away 
You gave me pain 
I wanted to die 
Yet even though you murdered me 
I can\'t help but miss you 
because you were so special 
you understood me 

You were just like me 
hurting inside 
You showed me I wasn\'t alone 
then you left me all alone 
and I miss you 
and even though it lasted short 
even though I never said so 
I loved you, still do 
and I miss you so much 

It hurts when I see you 
stabbing at my heart 

But I must face it 
it\'s been a long time 
and you hate me 
you don\'t care 

I just wish you could see the world through my eyes 
feel my pain 
share my sorrow 
just for once 

But it\'s pointless 
you don\'t care 
and worst of all.... 

you don\'t even seem to know
