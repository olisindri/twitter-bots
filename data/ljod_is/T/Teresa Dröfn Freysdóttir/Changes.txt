Changes

Changes have been made, 
defined priorities. 
The sweet, tender love we had, 
has died, became extinct. 
I didn\'t mean to hurt you, 
but you know my temper. 
It\'s time for me to focus, 
focus on myself and my needs. 

All your troubles rested heavily on my shoulders. 
I didn\'t have time to deal with all of it. 
I loved you while it lasted, 
now we\'ve grown apart. 
Nothing in common anymore. 
And I was so sick of you 
thrushing your believes upon me. 

We are very different people 
with different believes. 
But we dissagree so much. 
Some of our believes 
drenched us into quarreling. 

We started out so alike 
but as time passed 
we became quite oppisites. 
I wish it didn\'t have to end so brutaly 
but it\'s already done. 

But how can you justify your actions? 
Making people believe I was using you? 
You know that\'s not the case. 
I thought you didn\'t believe in lies? 
I guess you do now.... 

In a way trying to be as friendly I can, 
considering all of the above, 
I think we shouldn\'t contact anymore... 
It will just make it worse. 
Evolve into yet another conflict. 

I\'m sorry..... 
Goodbye......
