The truth is a lie

I extinguish the light 
render it\'s death. 
There is no light, 
light is dead. 

Lying on your altar 
hoping to be spareed 
my love lies bleeding 
please take me instead. 

As told by the holy ones 
my lessens to learn 
jouney to a world afar 
and seek the truth of faith 

I sat out to find the truth 
I travelled far 
By the time I got to you 
you were already dead 
and the darkness whispered to me 
so sweetly: 
\"The truth you seeketh is a lie\" 

The I know I had been betrayed 
used by the holy ones 
They knew I couldn\'t save you 
so they sent me 
to finish this pointless crusade 

Falling to my knees 
strained and out of breath 
dissapointed, discovering 
my whole life was a lie 
repeating over and over again 
in my head 
\"The truth you seeketh is a lie\" 
that is the only truth left in this world.
