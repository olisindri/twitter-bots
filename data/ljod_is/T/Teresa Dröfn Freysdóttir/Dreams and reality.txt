Dreams and reality

I had this dream last night 
once again 
about you and me. 
I met you last weekend 
once again 
it was you and me. 

But my dream is different 
different from reality 

In my dream you love me 
In my dream you kiss me 
In my dream you touch me 
In my dream I\'m yours 
In my dream I\'m not afraid 
afraid of telling you what\'s in my heart 
In my dream I\'m not afraid 
afraid of telling you about my feelings 

In real life we\'re just friends 
In real life you don\'t love me 
In real life I\'m not yours 
Sometimes you kiss me 
Sometimes you touch me 
It feels so right 
But it\'s just that, nothing more 
Still it get\'s my hopes up 
you wouldn\'t do this if you didn\'t 
in someway find me attractive... 
Would you? 

In real life I\'m a coward 
so afraid to tell you... 
so afraid you\'ll deny me and never talk to me again. 
You melt my heart...
