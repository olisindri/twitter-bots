Sometimes

My life seems so dull, so incompleted 
so worthless, I just simly wanna break down and cry 
My thoughts streach towards you 
I need you 
Can\'t you tell? 
Can\'t you see it in my eyes? 
Cuz sometimes I just wanna die 
Sometimes I feel so dead 
Everyday without your love is hurting me 
Yet you said you won\'t hurt me no more 
Sometimes I just wanna die 

There just ain\'t no way surviving this painful life without you 
And I don\'t wanna feel this pain 
At night I cry in vain, for so long, it seems forever 
It never goes away 
I just wish I was someone in your eyes 
I wish I was something better 
Please tell me I\'m someone 
Please tell me that you cared 
Cuz I never can forget this pain 
Don\'t make me cry no more 
Don\'t make me hurt no more 
Just look me in the eyes and tell me 
that sometimes you feel the same 
and sometimes you wish me back
