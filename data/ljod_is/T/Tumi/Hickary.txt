Hickary

Across the meadow,
throttle over the sea
lies a shadow in a bottle
and his name is hickary 

Hickary, Hickary
youre a lonely beast
of darkness and voids
created for mischief
by the evil dr.Zoid

Youre an one way-ticket
to deaths admission
or a lonely let-down
of a wondeful vision

As a murderous vision
of a madmans dreams and frovision
as you clinch across your missery 
Hickary,Hickary soon you will be free
