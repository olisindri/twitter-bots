\" Words unspoken \"

\"Words unspoken\"

Echos,
in the hidden corners of my mind.
Words unspoken,
words that never came alive.
I have covered every range of emotion, 
cut to the truth and watched it bleed.
I could come on as strong and willfull,
but im waiting for my sky to fall.
I am a woman,
fragile but not breakable.
Growing wiser by the day.
Busy holding on and keeping together.
I still have words unspoken, 
waiting to be given life.
