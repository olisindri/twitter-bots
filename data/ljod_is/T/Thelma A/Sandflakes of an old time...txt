Sandflakes of an old time..

Blue clouds, I want to be, 
alone, just me and the only one.
Soft blowing wind,gentle seabreeze.
Smell the sent.
I stand, as an individual.
Sandflakes of an old time,
running smoothly through my fingers.
A timeless beeing,
a worthless memory.
White sheets and flying feathers.
Sunsets and a tear. 
Another minute, a broken heart.
A past of us, you and our love.
I listen...to the sea sing.
As my tears fall lightly,
and unite the ocean.
