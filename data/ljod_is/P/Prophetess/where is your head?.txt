where is your head?

My friend
don\'t go
we haven\'t talked in so long
tell me of your travels
of what you have found
and what you left behind

I\'ve been wondering
lately
why your head is missing
in all my photos

You see
I woke up one day
as the phone rang
and from that day
the images changed

or

maybe
you never had a head
maybe
I simply did not notice
untill now?

I can\'t say I\'m sure anymore

But I think I remember
that it seemed to look
from certain angles
somewhat like mine
