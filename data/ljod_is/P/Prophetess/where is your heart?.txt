where is your heart?

My friend
what a surprise
I hope 
you have not been
standing there for long

I\'ve been so busy 
growing my flower
I don\'t even notice you anymore

but tell me,

what has happened
to your chest?

it looks
as if
the heart
is missing

I see
You keep it in your wallet
where it\'s always been

I hope it\'s comfortable 
there between 
the 10\'s and the 20\'s
