the first you

and then I come to you

with a smiling mind
and giggling heart,
full of tender 
floating 
softness 
of glowing dark

quiet flames 
play
a sleepy melody

inside
untamed butterflies
everywhere
the scent of angels
on my blanket of feathers
embracing the sweetness
of anticipation

in this gold hue grows
a blooming field

of love for you
