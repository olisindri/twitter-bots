of time-burner

time-burner
is holding on

he\'d be long gone
if he wasn\'t so strong

his mind is brave
but in his heart
there hides but shallow hope
still unrecognised
and rooted fear 
runs unrestricted

scared at last
his temple of mind
becomes unfastened
and then
so becomes
his grip

the fall brought the end of fear
but not of hope

now his only fuel
is you
