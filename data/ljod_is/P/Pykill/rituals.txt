rituals

every morning 
you open your eyes 
stare at the ceiling 
look for the light 
slowly roll over 
step out of the bed 
your feet on the floor 
freezing concrete 
stumble to the kitchen 
grab with cold hands 
the first cup of coffee 
your miracle for today 
sit down by the window 
silently drink 
think of nothing today 
think of nothing today 

get dressed by a ritual 
get dressed in a heartbeat 
nudity isn\'t accepted 
and nudity is cold 
pick up random clothes 
from the bedroom floor 

wear layers of them 
wear layers of them 

and hide behind them 
hide behind them 

... 

every morning 
get out of the house 
where the sunshine is sullen 
and summer is dull 
eye-contacts aren\'t allowed 
so you stare at your toes 

think invisible 
think untouchable 

every morning 
it\'s all the same 
you wake up again 
and there\'s still a brick in your head

it\'s not a poem 
it\'s not a rhyme 
it\'s just another way of killing time
