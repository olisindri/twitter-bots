Endless circle

A guy full of anger
opens the door,
sees in my eyes
i\'m begging for more.
Lifs his arm
and hits my face,
and rest of it
is a time race.
I love him and
I hate him so
but somehow I
just can\'t let go.
Those feelings are
long time gone,
but his anger
kinda turns me on.
Set me free
and let me go
I can\'t do this
not ever, no.
My love for you
just has to die,
now i\'m ready
farwell, bye.
