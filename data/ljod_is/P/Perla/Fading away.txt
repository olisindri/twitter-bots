Fading away

Am I lonely?
Am I sad?
At least I\'m feeling
very bad.
All my feelings
so messed up
I wish I could just
turn to dust.

I take my knife
and cut me deep.
One moment I think
I\'m gonna weap.
But I just have to
fight the tears.
Like I\'ve done
all these years.
There is blood everywhere
I\'m bleeding fast
soon this thought
will be the last.
The world is fading
I can\'t see clear,
the death is coming
it\'s coming near.

I\'m feeling better
now I\'m gone.
Finally I\'m free
\'cause the death did come.
