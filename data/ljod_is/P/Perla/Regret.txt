Regret

Last night
We had a fight
I said I hated you
That’s not right.
I ran out
Crying up loud
Because of it
I’m not proud.
I wish I could
Just turn around
And feel the love
That I had found.

When I came back
Your skin was cold
You eyes were open,
Your soul was sold.
I called an ambulance,
And said you were gone
They said they would get you
And soon it was done.

Still I think about
Our last fight,
And often, I ask god
“Why didn’t you
Do what was right?”
He was my love
He was my life
All I think about
Is my knife,
But if I leave
More people would feel
What I felt
When he left.

Today I still miss you
I love you as well
All I can do
Is telling you that.
But I know you will wait
At the door of the gate.
Soon I’ll meet you
Now I’m old.
I’ve said goodbye
To all my friends
And to you I’ll fly
When my life ends. (when it ends)
