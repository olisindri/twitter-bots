Madness

All the times you didn\'t care
I was feeling bad
and all the times you even tried
you just made me mad.

All I want for you is joy
and take away your pain
when you\'re whining about this girl
you\'re driving me insaine.

Can\'t you see, are you blind?
I\'m in love with you
all I pray and hope for
eventually you\'ll love me too.
