Trapped

Running,
trying to excape
from my life..
everything.
I feel like the world
is falling apart.

I try to smile
I try to laugh
nothing works.
I can\'t even
pretend I\'m happy.
Outside I\'m sad
inside I\'m mad
and the other way around..

Dead roses falling
all around me,
I try to forget
forever.
But I can\'t
I look into your eyes
and I clear my mind.

Wish I could stay in this moment forever.
