I want you

I want your body
I want your soul,
I want you beside me,
all of you, whole.

I want to touch
and see you smile,
feel your heart beat
for a while.

I\'d give my life
to get your love,
oh please god send me
help from above.

Hopeless I pray
for mercy and wisdom
I wand your love,
please give me some.

I\'m all yours
just if you want me,
now tell me the truth
and set your feelings free.
