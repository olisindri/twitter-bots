Sorrow

Unhappy,
so sad.
And maybe also
a little bit mad.
Feel so sorry
trying to not worry,
nothing works
only sorrow.

So few words
can cut so deep,
inside I\'m crying
outside I\'m smiling.
It hurts so bad
to pretend.
I\'m so sad..

Sun ain\'t shining
the rainbow is gone.
Always raining
like the world is crying.

My soul is sorrow
sorrow is my soul.
