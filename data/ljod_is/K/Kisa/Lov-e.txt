Lov-e

Love is like
A hundres million feelings
wrappped into one person
who keeps somone\'s happyness in their smile
who holds someone\'s heart in their hands
and would rather die than letting go

Love keeps poets sweating,
Love keeps young girls smiling
and old men smirk with a memory of a certain lady
(or lad, if that\'s the case)
Love keeps writers writing, love keeps artists painting
Love keeps movies selling
Love keeps people guessing
Love keeps the smile on your face...
