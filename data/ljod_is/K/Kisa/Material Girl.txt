Material Girl

We fill our lives with meaningless things 
To block out the world and its pain
And those who see through it we secretly hate
Because we fear that we might, too.

Cheap things are worthless, 
Expensiveness counts
Your heart came for free
We buy things, we build things,
 We long for everything Prada
And we give things importance
So we have something to believe in

People who die, people who suffer
They are the people no-one cares for any longer
Because it’s not in fashion anymore.
Never mind love, forget about compassion
There were movies about it – both flopped
Disney’s about as much care and love
It’s healthy to show children anymore

We build castles to defend our belongings
We buy things to show off, and lock ourselves in
And within the thick walls
Covered with prizes
It’s easier to pretend we’re happy within.
