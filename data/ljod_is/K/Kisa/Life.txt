Life

A cut\'s just a cut
And no-one is hurt
A bloody black shirt
Red stains and brown dirt

A cut\'s just a cut
But No-one gets hurt
A wonderful feeling
Each scratch, slit and cut

But a cut\'s just a cut
and they\'ll all make me pure
The rose-red blood flowing
resisting death\'s allure

A cut\'s just a cut
And no-one gets hurt
Each one makes me better
I\'ll bleed till I\'m whole

A cut\'s just a cut
And no-one is hurt
Dreams can make you better
But dreams will make you hurt

A cut stands for nothing
when nobody cares
The pain will cure all things
but no-one else dares
