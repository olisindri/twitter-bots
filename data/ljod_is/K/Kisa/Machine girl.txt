Machine girl

You can tell
from the scars on my arms
and cracks in my hips
and the dents in my car
and the blisters on my lips
that I’m not the most careful of girls

you can tell
from the glass on the floor
and the strings that are breaking
and I keep on breaking more
and it looks like I am shaking
but it\'s just the temperature
and then again
if it were any colder, could I disengage
if I were any older , could I act my age?
but I don’t think that you’d believe me
it\'s
not
the
way
I’m
meant
to
be
it\'s just the it made me
It just the way the emptiness made me
and you can tell
from the state of my room
That the mess isn’t just on the inside
and I’ve got some issues to work through
there I go again
pretending to be alive
pretending to able to
work throught the mess of me
I have no real soul beneath the surface
trying to convince you that I do
it was accidentally on purpose

I am not so serious
this passion is a plagiarism
I am the world\'s worst accident

and you can tell
by the red in my eyes
and the bruises on my thighs
and the knots in my hair
that I’m not right now at all
there I go again
pretending that I’ll fall
don\'t call the doctors
just
let
me
crash
and
burn

and you can tell
that I’m sorry that I asked
though you did everything you could
(like any decent person would)
but I might be catching so don\'t touch
you\'ll stop believing that what you see is real
don’t touch my hands
because the bandages will all come off

and you can tell
from the smoke at the stake
that the current state is critical
well it is the little things, for instance:
in the time it takes to break it she can make up ten excuses:
I’m short on sleep, and I feel lonely or sad,
or it’s the state of the world or me or you
and it’s not my fault
don’t blame me, don’t listen
don’t make me face the consequences

of what I do
I won’t hurt you, I swear
I hurt me, but you don’t care
Let me be
Let me freeze
Inside of what I seem to be.
It’s so sad
I’m so sad
If you break through the emptiness
And then through the loneliness
And the sadness after that
All you’ll se is pain
A rusty machine soul
That fooled you all, but not me
Because my soul doesn’t work anymore
And why fight for the life
Of the already dead?
Why work on to save
A living shell of a little baby girl

I don’t believe there is a cure for this
these feelings I’m stuck with
The feelings that I make me feel
The feelings that I seem to feed
With my soul and my mind and my heart and my sight
And there is nothing I can do
And there is nothing you’ll ever do
That can save me from myself

I am useless
I am
behold the worlds worst accident
I’m sick, I must die

Why won’t you please just let me?
And why won’t I?
