I am Sorry

I\'m sorry for the times that I made you cry and for the times that I told you a lie and when I killed your dreams well I didn\'t mean to make you scream, but I got to say how I feel before I grow older, well you are like a stone hanging a round my neck you see I got to cut it loose before it breaks my back. I\'m sorry but I can’t change my ways you know I\'ve tried but I\'m still the same. Well I can carry the burden of pain because it isn’t the first time that a man goes insane.
