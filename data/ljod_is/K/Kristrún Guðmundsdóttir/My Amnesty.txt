My Amnesty

I can't believe, and sometimes in my dreams
It's you who cuts my skin
Just to see how much it bleeds
Please let me in

I stand outside here in the rain
And it washes away, away my sanity
I feel so alone, alone again
I miss my amnesty

I need to forget, i don't want to remember you
You have caused me too much pain
Still i wish you were here, it's true
To lift me out of the water once again

I stand outside here in the rain
And it washes away, away my sanity
I feel so alone, alone again
I miss my amnesty
