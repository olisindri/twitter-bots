My Sorry

I know I promised
I even knew it at the time
But you see, my senses vanished
And I went on with it, anyway

But my sorry don't mean much
I should have known better
But when I felt his touch
I lost control

Never before did I feel
The way I felt that night
Like my dreams were real
Dreams I never had before

But my sorry don't mean much
I should have known better
But when I felt his touch
I lost control

You know deep within your heart
I didn't mean to hurt you
We should make a new start
and forget about the past

I know my sorry don't mean much
I should have known better
But when I felt his touch
I lost control
