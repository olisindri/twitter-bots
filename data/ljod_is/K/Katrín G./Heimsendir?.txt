Heimsendir?

Now the world has come to an end!
We are doomed to perpetual 
suffering.
Unless we end it ourselves!
Then we´ll roam around in Purgatory
forever.
If you end it for me ,
you´ll burn in Hell,
but I´ll go to Heaven!
But that won´t do, 
´cause I don´t want
you to feel pain.
I don´t want to die, but I don´t want to suffer either.
Why, oh why does the apocalypse 
have to come now?
Why can´t it come
when I´m already dead?
