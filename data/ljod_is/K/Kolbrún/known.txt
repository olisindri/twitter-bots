known

i could only stay
for i let you do to me
can\'t let you in
where are you

i only would stay,
for you do to me,
something inside me
can\'t get out.

thoughts are strange
feelings are weird
nights are long
when you are near

so stop taking my mind
rescue me from you
my mind is drifting
drifting apart 
from me to you
