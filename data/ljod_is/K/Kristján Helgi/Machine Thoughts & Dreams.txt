Machine Thoughts & Dreams

Poem after poem
I struggle for hours
Without satisfaction or joy
I realize that all I have
is nothing spectacular
and I have no powers

I am but human
in these crazy times
and start to question myself
what if I , and only what if
I am not meant to survive

Spiritual awareness
What does that mean ?
is it a joke
for now I have but no dreams
no hopes or fears
for I am only ... A machine
