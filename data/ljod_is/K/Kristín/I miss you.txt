I miss you

I met a guy, he gave me
the best thing I ever got. 
His love, his trust, his everything. 
Wow, he is so hot. 

We had a time together
but then I went away. 
The hardest thing I ever did, 
Why couldn’t I stay ?

I think of you my day along
and imagine if you were here. 
But just a dream, it’s sad to know
that baby, you are there. 

I miss the things about you, 
I miss the things you do. 
I miss me, how I am the days	
when I hang around with you. 

Watch you when you’re shaving,
you have this sexy face.
How you walk beside me, 
you do it with a grace. 
 
Another day you told me, 
no matter what we  do, 
you will always be there for me, 
and Gad, I know that’s true. 

If you have a bad day
and everythings goes wrong
remember that you have a girl
who loves you- let\'s be strong.
