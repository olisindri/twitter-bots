Killing Life

I lay there with my head in a bag
Thousand thoughts going threw my mind
Screaming for the answer
Biting nails and blood dripping
You call out my name
Useless anger and fright
Heavely falls into the deep
Aiming for the spot
You feel free
There is so much blood
Pale and weak
Your head is about to blow up into tiny pieses
So heavy to hold up
Tears blend in the blood
You had to be someone else
Insted of you and me
Trying hard not to let it show
Running away from all emotions
Killing life.
