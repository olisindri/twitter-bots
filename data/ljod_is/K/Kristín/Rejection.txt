Rejection

I can\'t even tell you a letter...
not even a word,
Nobody knows me or wants to believe,
for what Ive seen is beyond your knowledge....
your body will reject your knowlegde to know,
you think I tell lies,
you think that I\'m fake,
you dont know that you are just scared,
you dont wanna know the truth.
you dont know that what I am telling you
is the honesty you will never know or hear..
