Goodbye

What hurts me the most is the love that you give me
Coz I dont think that I deserve that kinda love
I’ve tried so much, that I’m burning inside
I cant find a reason to stay no more

I hope you understand, its not your fault
But I have to go. I blame my self
For the pain I have in my heart
All I have is pain except the love that is yours

So I’ll go now, I hope You’ll forgive me 
The pain that one coused me
I can no longer bare 
But even tough I’m gone I’ll always love you

I want you to remember that time we had together
And never to forget that if I go
I’ll always be in your heart
Like you will be in mine
