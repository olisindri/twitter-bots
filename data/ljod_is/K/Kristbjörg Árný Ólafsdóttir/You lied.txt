You lied

My eyes read sorrow
How could you say
My life was worth nothing
After those words you made

How can i live now
You have lied
My reputation
Has come to noun

How can i look
In my mothers eyes
Tell her while daddy cryes
That you have lied

Those words you said
Were sad and blue
Lies i canâ€™t say
Not so soon
