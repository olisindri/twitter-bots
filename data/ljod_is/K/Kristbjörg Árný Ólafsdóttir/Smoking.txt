Smoking

People used to tell me
how lofe comes and goes
never would think
i\'d love you so

You lie here beside me
i listen to you breathe
i can no longer sleep
for the thing that is bothering thea

You woke up this morning
put up an emty smile
the pain goes right through me
like hunded stabbing knifes

Your home has no meaning
you know you\'r leaving soon
the docktor wants to see you 
about that thing that bothered thea

where walking on the shore
we finally know the truth
your final day is
comming soon

i wake up in the night
your having trouble to breathe
we know that the thing bothering you
has come to an end

You lie in my arms
having trouble whit air
i know it you last night
you wisper in my ear

i\'m lookin at your cofin
trying to haim my tears
they flow whitput willing
i miss thea

I sit alone in the living room
think about the last thing you said
you said to me, whit sadnes of tears
i love you my little thing

now he is not alive
canser took his lif away
he smoked 3 times a day
his life was never a good thing.
