The rain

have you ever seen the rain?
poorin down my window
lookin\' like a star
glansing upon where you are

It is cold and blue
fallin\' on my head
while i walk in dispair
it is in my hair

people don\'t notice
it runs through the drains
comes through the pipes
and into our vains

canser is so close now
it\'s getting upon me
i drank the whater
that once was rain
