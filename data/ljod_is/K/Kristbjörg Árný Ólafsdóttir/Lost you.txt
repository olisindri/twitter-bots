Lost you

i walk in the isle
i see you 
glow all around you
all people to charish you 

i come closer
my sorrow starts to show
i look down your cauffin
you face so frown

i still remember
how you got away
all those nights i pray
that it hadnâ€™t gone that way

the car it smashed right through it
and killed all inside
that is what happened 
on that higway road

i lost you that dampty night
it was my fault
i should have thought of you 
befor i drank and drove
