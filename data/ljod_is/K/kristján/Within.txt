Within

within my mind 
 
 i feel your soul
 trembling beaneath the knife
 the light blinding 
 sealing my doom

 i saw it all
 within your mind 
 within your soul 
 our doom was found
 
 within  it all 
 it all began
 only made 
 to end with this light 
 and see it now
 it´s all so clear
 your life´s gone low
 the end is near

 i feel your end 
 within  your soul
 it all ends here
 
 in your darkest dreams
 i was made
 and in my love 
 you die with me

 your blood flows trough 
 my hole on your head 
 my unfilling void
 can never be healed 
  
 within Your mind 
 you forged our doom
 within your soul 
 you forged our end

 within their mind they see your end
 and within their tears 
 they seal your doom
 it all ends here
