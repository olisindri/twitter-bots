That smell

Its Sunday morning
I arrive home
with joy in my step.
The joy from
a wild night.
I sit at the Kitchen table,
keep a glass of milk
and a doughnut company
asking myself
the question
‘Should I take a shower now or when I wake up’

There is nothing wrong with
taking a shower in the middle of the night
but I usually don’t.

I am tired,
I am lazy,
I am drunk.
I hope she wont
smell her
when I sneak into bed.
