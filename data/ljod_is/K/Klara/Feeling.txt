Feeling

nobody understands this feeling in my hart

its like im trapet and i cannot run 

its like im sad but nothing to cry for

nobody i can talk to, nobody that 

understands this feeling in my hart

this lonlyness, but how much i hug you

it never works, i dont know what to do!!!

i sit in my room and cry and cry but never 

know why, lookin out the window watchin the

sea, watching the buirds flying happy in the

scy, people happpy never so unlucky to have

this feeling

never so insecure

never so sad 

never so lonley 

never so i dont know...
