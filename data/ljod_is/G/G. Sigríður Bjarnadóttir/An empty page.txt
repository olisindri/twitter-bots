Not today
not tomorrow
instead I will cry 
and live in sorrow

Not tomorrow 
not today
I am not willing
but I have to stay

Not next week
not this year
I am so sad 
Because you are not near

Not this year
not next week
I lost my temper
I am getting weak

Not now
not ever
I am a volcano 
in stormy weather

Not ever
not now
I erupt
my lava flouts around

Not dead
not alive
still I know
I will get by

Not alive
not dead
what I always feared
is in my head
