Varði [Enska]

Now you have left planet earth,
now you're gone for good.
Do you know what you were worth?
More than anything could.

I miss so much,
I'll never see you again.
The feeling is such,
pain, nothing but pain.

But the one little light,
in all this dark.
Is that heaven is bright,
there you will park.

Varði, I love you.
You were my friend.
I can never repay you,
for the time we did spend.

I'll always protect,
the memory of you.
You're decision I respect,
it was up to you.

Against your big illness
you're soul was defenceless.
Now you're soul I bless,
go rock heaven senseless.
