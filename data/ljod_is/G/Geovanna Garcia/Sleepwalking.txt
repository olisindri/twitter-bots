Sleepwalking

Seeing angels sitting on my bed
telling me my heart is broken.
Touching my blinded head
seeing what has not been spoken. 

Here in my bed I cry for him.
He\'s forever lost, left with the pain. 
Burn my mind burn for him. 
And save me with your rain.

My sweet angels dry my tears.
But take not my love for him, Iâ€™d rather die sad.
Take this body and my fears.
And leave me alone to be mad.
