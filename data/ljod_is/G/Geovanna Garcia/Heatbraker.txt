Heatbraker

Oh star bright angels give me nothing but 
forgiveness
the time was never in beat with my sadness 
What have I lost in this life of mine,
which I never had?
The chances to love, hate, cry or laugh?
I felt so alone all this time and in an 
endless fight.
But all this time you kissed me good morning 
and good night. 
Only if I would have known what sadness laid 
in my head
you were maybe still in my bed.
Kiss me bright angel and say ones more good 
night.
And for me it will turn off my light.
