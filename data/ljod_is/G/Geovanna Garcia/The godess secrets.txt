The godess secrets

Her heart tried to resist,

her eyes tried not to see but unconsciously 

her heart broke and her eyes saw behind the 

tears.

And with her charm and innocent she became 

the forbidden fruit.

Spellbound to be tasted by promised men.

A goddess to men on there war between love 

and lust.

But love conquers all and they all turn 

safely to there home.

But sometimes just sometimes they leave 

parts of there heart with her.

And those soldiers she\'ll never ever 

forget.
