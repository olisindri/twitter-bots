Missed

I kissed you softly on the forehead,
layed you gently on the bed.
To think of this all, it makes me sad,
in my mind, memories only glad.
Looking at you makes me afraid,
that morning I was going to tell you straight,
my soul and my heart was yours to keep,
You were everything I´d ever need.
Shaking, I slowly walked the floor,
Opened the door and just before
I closed my eyes and saw the light,
blindly I ran into the night.
Away, far away, I write these lines,
it´s hard to tell about those times.
and honestly, I have to say this,
all you need to know is in this kiss.
