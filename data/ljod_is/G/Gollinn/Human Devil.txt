Human Devil

Locked up, tied and gaged 
Stuck in my own imagination 
I\'ve been told I\'m not like them 
I\'m like an infestation 
I cannot be driven away 
I cannot be hidden 
you better know I\'m here to stay 
I\'m gonna haunt your soul 
I am not a normal guy 
I\'m not just a human 
I allways was a little shy 
but now I\'m out in the open 
I will soon have all the souls 
the it will all be over
