King of the world

talk about this world grows loud 
I can\'t hear any words 
still I stand upright and proud 
ready to faace the rest of the world 

I feel like I am dominant 
I feel so in control 
People say I\'m arrogant 
but I\'m just realistic 

the world today is cold and cruel 
and chaos governs the people 
but still I long to rule 
want to save the people 

bring light into this life 
not with a gun or a knife 
belive in justice 
roll gods dice
