Freak in me

you are inside my head 
I can\'t see whats bad 
I can see your eyes 
in my eyes in the mirror 
you are not like me 
but still we are the same 
what do I have to do 
to make you go away! 
GO AWAY! 
I don\'t need thst shit 
you give me every day 
all day 
I can see that youre not gonna go away 
people are lookin\' at me 
like I\'m some kind of freak 
please go away 
so I can be saine again! 
FREAK! 
you are in me 
we are the same 
still I hate you 
get the fuck away! 
GO AWAY! 
why won\'t you leave me alone 
you know I\'m too paranoid 
I can hear footsteps 
by my bed at night 
I clear my head of all thoughts 
but you are still inside 
why won\'t you go away 
so I can keep my pride 
GO AWAY! 
I am sorry 
that I blaimed you 
I can feel you 
slippin\' away from me! 
GO AWAY! 
FREAK!
