The Pathetic Saint

I feel alone 
my heart is broken 
and so is my neck 
say not a single tone 
I\'m suck a wreck 
my wings are broken 
my harp has no strings 
I have fallen 
I miss my wings 
cause now I can\'t fly 
I\'m just a mortal 
still I can not tell a lie 
I\'m a saint 
still I am hated 
I see the world collapse 
and can\'t do a thing 
my voice is gone 
so I can not sing 
my divine powers have faded 
I\'m a loser 
I have failed 
I drop 
I die
