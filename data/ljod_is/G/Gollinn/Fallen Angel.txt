Fallen Angel

darkness fills my soul inside 
evil creeps behind me 
the devil takes me for a ride 
in hell I meet my brethren 
I am not of the godly kind 
I am devilish too 
now I leave you all behind 
to out what is true 

is the world a good place to be 
is the world what it seems 
is there more than we can see 
is there a meaning to it all 

now I come back 
dumb as before 
lay down my sack 
it is tattered and torn 
like my soul has become
