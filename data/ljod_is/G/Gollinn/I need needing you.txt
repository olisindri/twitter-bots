I need needing you

what is love
and do we need it
what is above
why can\'t we see it
these feelings inside me
tie me down
please set me free
ris me of these emotions
then I could do as I please
instead I\'m set in a certain mode
pushed to my knees
just to please you
I\'m sick of it
but I like it
I\'m sick of you
but I love you
