First degree murder

I am judged by other people 
they say I\'m evil 
they say I don\'t care 
but who are they to judge 
they weren\'t there 
I didn\'t mean for him to get killed 
I\'m sure he was supposed to live 
now my blanks are filled 
I remember 
I shot him in the head 
snuck up on him in bed 
he was screwing my girl 
I killed them both 
I made an oath 
not to tell a single soul 
what had happened 
then my heart became a hole 
I didn\'t care 
about anything or anyone 
I had to hide, but where 
I was dommed to be jailfood 
doomed to die slow 
I never ment to be rude 
just wanted to lay low 
but I have failed 
lost the game 
oh man 
how lame
