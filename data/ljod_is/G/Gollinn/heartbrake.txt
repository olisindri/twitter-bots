heartbrake

the taste of your touch 
yur tender lips 
the look in your eyes 
and the way you wiggle your hips 
I hold you so close 
smell your hair 
you are my rose 
so sweet and tender 
you trat me so bad 
you drive me away 
what we could have had 
you have ruined 
just like my soul 
my heart is crushed 
in my chest, a hole 
around my neck, a rope 
kick away the chair 
suicide is my last hope 
I long for death
