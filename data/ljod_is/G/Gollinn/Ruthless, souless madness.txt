Ruthless, souless madness

Beat me, eat me, treat me bad 
I can feel me going mad 
youre a fool and youve been had 
you fuckin stupid redhead 
I hate your guts and hope you die 
a slow and painfull death 
no I do not tell a lie 
I have just altered the truth 
now youre dieing at my hand 
your blood is on my hands 
holding a knife, IÂ´m on my knees in the sand 
I lough outloud 
and hope you hear the sickness in my voice 
cause your existance has been annoying 
youre just an irritateing noise 
and now I turn down your volume
