crossing the line

this person inside me 
trying to break out 
people cannot see 
makes me scream and shout 
hate me life 
more and more each day 
want to slit my throat with a knife 
cause noone will hear what I have to say 

cause of this I\'m lonly 
and have no friends 
only the pain of others makes me happy 
when the life of another ends 

I see myself as a monster 
that terrorises all 
destruction is my only skill 
my grasp is gone 
now I cannot kill
