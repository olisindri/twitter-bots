Depression dagger

a dagger twists so deep in my head 
my blood is flowing as I drop on my bed 
I hate this life and just want to die 
you need not know why 

I\'ve been this way since I was born 
before I could talk a christian sworn 
I never said yes I belive in god 
I didn\'t even try to nod 

now I am dead and not going to heaven 
I\'ve benn wanting to die since I was seven 
but I\'m not going down to hell 
now that I\'m rotting I feel well
