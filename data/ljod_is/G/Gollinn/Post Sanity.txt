Post Sanity

I was the new kid 
nobody liked me 
no matter where I hid 
they couldn\'t let me be 
I saw that red head 
coming at me 
he didn\'t like me 
I knew ho would beat me 
this has left a hole 
there\'s a scar in my soul 

you will see me 
standing outside your door 
you will hear me 
knocking on your door 
you will see me 
holding a huge fucking knife 
you will know me 
I will kill you 

I had to move 
far away from that place 
my mind was filled 
with pictures of his ugly face 
so I decided 
to seek vengence right away 
that decicion 
has been made to stay 
his fate has been made 
he will fall in my shade 

you see me 
standing outside your door 
you hear me 
knocking on your door 
you see me 
holding a huge fucking knife 
you know me 
I am killing you 

now I\'ve killed him 
now my plan to escape 
I have decided 
to face my actions and stay 
I will be busted 
and I will confess 
still I will be fried 
cause noone belives me 
people hate me 
for beliving in justice 

you saw me 
standing outside your door 
you heard me 
knocking on your door 
you saw me 
holding a huge fucking knife 
you knew me 
I have killed you 

now I\'m locked up 
and await my death 
execution 
by a lethal injection 
but I\'m okay with it 
my scars are healed 
I feel the poison 
my fate is sealed 
now I\'m dieing 
but I\'m still smiling 

now that I\'m dead 
I won\'t stop smiling 
cause you are dead 
my life is complete 
I taste your blood 
on my cold lips 
now your dead 
and gone away, motherfucker!
