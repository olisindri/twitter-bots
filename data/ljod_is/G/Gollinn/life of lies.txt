life of lies

I don\'t know what the meaning of life is 
I wan\'t my head stuck on a spike 
I don\'t wanna go on with this life shit 
I wanna be disected in every way 
I wan\'t my life to be taken n\' bended 
I wan\'t my life to be cut up n\' ended 
now I know that god has surrendered 
now I know that religeon has ended 

this whole world is fucked up n\' twisted 
this funckin\' life will make me unhappy 
my shit life is gonna be wasted 
shame on every priest in the country 
I have lived a log life of lies 
a lie you\'re gonna help me untie 
set a snare and leave me to die 
you will regret this and wonder why 

gonna help me kill myself 
gonna place my head on a shelf 
gonna tear my body apart 
my death is a fuckin\' piece of art
