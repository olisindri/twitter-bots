ashamed

I hate this feeling 
I\'m filled with shame 
ashamed of my actions 
ashamed of my name 
I feel like life is changing 
it does\'t feel like a game 
but more like a process 
filled with torture and pain 
I\'ve gotta go 
this has gotta end 
there is a long road ahead 
and I\'m not trying to be bad 
when I say that 
death is our final destination
