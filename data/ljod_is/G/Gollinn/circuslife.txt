circuslife

being called wierd by the freaks of the circus 
it is very unpleasant 
and haveing to live there 
when in your eyes I am but a peasant 
piked on for being myself 
not following the commands of others 
going my own way 
no matter whom it bothers 
we are not alike 
even thought we are brothers 
I will not bow and bend 
just becouse you say so 
this has got to come to an end 
before we loose our star attraction 
then noone will come to see us 
and noone will care 
nad thus 
we cannot take part any more
