Imaginary world

when I was a little kid 
nobody liked me 
I ran and hid 
in my own little world 
but now I\'m stuck 
inside my own head 
I have no luck 
in trying to get out 
I hate myself and I wan\'t to die 
but nobody knows why 
cause I can\'t tell them 
from inside my head 
life doesn\'t look real 
so why go on 
life is of no use to me 
this is something 
only I see 
for that everyone is blind 
I go to heaven 
and leave you all behind
