the power of hatred

Moonshine fills my eyes with sadness 
makes me cry 
filling my soul with darkness 
makes me scream 
I hate my life 
I wan\'t to die 
I wan\'t to kill you too 
but I dont know why 
my head full of shit 
my eyes filled with hate 
when I see you 
my hate for you rises with my heart rate 
my heart stops 
I drop and lay in the grass 
but my head keeps on going 
and I see insects eating my body 
my death is not the end 
now I\'m all bloody 
but I feel no pain 
but my hate for you still remains
