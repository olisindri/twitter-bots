Playground

I\'m locked up in here 
threw away the key 
now I\'m stuck in here 
for eternety 
my mind id gone away 
I\'ve got lots to say 
but noone\'s here to hear 
not even you, my dear 

now I\'m all alone 
noone here but me 
every one is gone 
there\'s darkness, I can\'t see 
I wan\'t you here with me 
I need someone to fuck 
I wish that you could be 
just as insane as me 

I was once as sane as you are 
but now I\'m fuckin\' crazy 
now I fighht my own war 
I\'m the captain and the general 
take away my pride and joy 
take away my little boy 
take away my family 
take my sanity 

I don\'t wanna go away 
I don\'t wanna have to stay 
theres darkness in my cell 
noone hears my yell 
I have gone insane 
theres nothing in my brain 
being fucked up is just something I did
