A hero, a king

my hands are tied 
I\'m stuck in this cave 
my sword so far away 
and I have more than myself to save 
all I have is a rose 
maybe it\'s magical 
nobody knows 
where I am 
I hear the dragon coming 
untie myself 
get my sword 
have to hide 
and slay the dragon 
to save my bride 
jump out and kill the beast 
and on its flesh I feast 
ride back to my kingdom 
where my servants scream in despair 
cause their king was gone 
but where 
noone knew 
but now I\'m back 
coutinue to rule 
and try to be fair 
and not cruel
