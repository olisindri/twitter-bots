what you are to me

I think I\'m blind 
can\'t see you 
not going to find 
what I seek 
my search for purity 
will never end 
for all humanity 
it serves well 
I\'m lost in lies 
lies of mine 
I brake all ties 
ties with you 
now I\'ve died 
and gone to heaven 
there I hide 
never to be found 
free from you 
and all your violence 
how could I know 
that I\'d end up hateing you
