whats the point in enduring

whats the point 
of living this life 
whats the point 
of dieing 
why do we endure 
this pain 
why do we endure 
so long 
how can there be 
a god 
why can\'t we see 
him 
who want\'s 
money 
when you can have 
love 
am I any more important 
than a dove 
why can\'t everyone 
be pleasant 
why do we ever 
lie 
why can\'t I just 
die
