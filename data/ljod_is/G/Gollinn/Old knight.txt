Old knight

I fear I have come to an end 
for that my sword is so hard to mend 
I can nolonger be a hero 
for that my strength is close to zero 
I try to act as I am fine 
but I blurt it all out with wine 

so now I\'m but a peasant 
this life is not pleasant 
or maybe it just not for me 
for that a hero I was made to be 

I cry myself to sleep at night 
for that I am no longer a knight 
I\'ve tried to ride my cow 
but I allways manage to fall somehow 

as I grow older 
my heart gets colder 
and I feel my life slipping away 
and I realize that heros come and go 
they are not here to stay
