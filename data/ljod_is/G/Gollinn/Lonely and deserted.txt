Lonely and deserted

Lonelyness and emptyness 
fill me up inside 
I feel abandoned, deserted 
I hvae my eyes wide open 
still I see noone 
cause noone is there 
I start to cry and run 
don\'t know where I\'m going 
or where I\'m coming from 
then I start to feel weak 
and I collapse in the sand 
how long have I been running? a day? a week? 
it doesn\'t matter 
I just lay there motionless 
waiting for it all to be over 
all this trying is pointless
