Good times end, bad times start

life is over 
it has come to an end 
I cannot go any lower 
I feel like shit 
my head filled with crap 
I cannot think straight 
I\'m about to snap 
going insaine 
or thats what my doc says 
that I\'m loosing it 
I wait and count the days 
that I have as a saine person 
its not long now 
I feel reason slipping away 
my imagination is taking over 
paranoia is here to stay 
I\'m one psychotic motherfucker
