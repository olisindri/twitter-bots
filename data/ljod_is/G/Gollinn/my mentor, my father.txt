my mentor, my father

look how far I\'ve come 
becouse of you 
I am what I wanted to be 
therefor I am no longer blue 
and finaly I see 
that you did so much 
I know now 
that I need your touch 
to be complete 
I act like you 
and talk like you 
I\'m apart of you 
I love you 
thank you dad....
