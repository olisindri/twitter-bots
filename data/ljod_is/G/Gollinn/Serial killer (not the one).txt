Serial killer (not the one)

the red sun shines down on me 
it fades like all the world 
dieing, of course, is not a sin 
but many have I done 

allways to me have people been 
nothing but tools for my atvantage 
I killed them with my heart of tin 
and never looked back in regret 

I hate myself and have allways done 
cause I\'m a sore fuckup 
now I know I\'m not the one 
cause now I\'m dead
