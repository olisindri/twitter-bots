It\'s life as we know it (sami√∞ \"98)

I\'ve got a fucked up freaky mind 
I deserve to be burned to ashes 
and blown off with the wind 
like a raging storm in the desert 
with the sun shining bright down on me 
but the suddenly total darkness 
it\'s so dark, everything seems to be invisible, I can\'t see 
it\'s like the world is at it\'s apocalypse 
dieing would be an unexpected plesure 
like a huge christmas package 
while living forever would be a total failiure 
pian is just apart of being alive
