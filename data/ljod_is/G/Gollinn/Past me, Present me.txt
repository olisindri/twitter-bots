Past me, Present me

I\'m all alone 
in a crowded mall 
my sun has shone 
but it shines no more 
I\'ve been abandoned 
left to die 
still I don\'t wonder 
or ask why 
cause I understand 
the feeling of hate 
cause I hate myself 
and for death I wait 
but this wait is long 
and without pleasures 
I lay on the floor 
and hope to be crushed 
by all the people walking by 
but they seem to avoid me 
I understand why 
cause I am repulsive 
and deserve to be helpless 
I just wait 
and hope I die of hunger
