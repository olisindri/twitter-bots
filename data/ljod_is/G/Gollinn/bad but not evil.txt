bad but not evil

get lost in the shadow of the past 
cannot hide what I\'ve done 
with everything moving so fast 
I get lost in chaos 
can\'t help being slow 
with this burden of sinds 
I hide and lay low 
don\'t wan\'t anyone to see 
how bad I\'ve been 
but what do you wan\'t me to be 
I can\'t be an angel 
I have no wings 
but although I\'m alot of things 
I am no devil 
I ain\'t that bad
