Circle of Sorrow

The life i choose to walk, the paths i choose to stalk, the way i hide my face, the way i face the life i mock.
Happyness is something that eludes me, confuses me, the way this life chooses to abuse me.
Complications, therapists talking about institusions.. Its all an illusion. 
Listen to my inner voice, the anger and fear, my eyes closing, hiding a tear.

Circle of sorrow, recepy of hate...

Sometimes i feel i have gone to far, sometimes it feels like im to late.
People talk about time healing, talk about the heart returning feeling.
Hope is the sister of Lie, Lie the brother of Jealousy, and im father to my own Mistakes.
