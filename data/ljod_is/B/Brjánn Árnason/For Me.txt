For Me

My life is now ready for all it takes
my future my destany said I would drop
the words broke my shoulders dried my lakes
but i will fight untill i reach the top 

This will be hard and i will be weak
but that is a price i will gladly bleed
for controlling my fate and raising my peak
to flower like forrests made from one seed
