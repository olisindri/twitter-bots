From the deepest pool

Now life showes you its deepest pool
The questions are coming, dont worry 
,just keep your cool

You know the answers you always did
You got them from your mother 
,when you were only a kid

I know its hard to think about them
I dont no when, but I know you\'ll 
,see all your treasures again

They will thrive,prosber and finally die
They will go on the journey you took 
,and then they ask me why

This is probably hard for you to see
your blindness has a reason so I askyou ,dont cry for me

After all we are all just Gods sinners
on this earth untill we reach the pool 
,and finally become winners
