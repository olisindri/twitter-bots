through my emetions

She takes me with her 
trough all her emotions
I follow her like the shadow
as the shadow that intervines
I have the choice i tell myself
trough all her emotions
I give in to all her temptations
temptations i canÂ´t even see
trough all her emotions
the ending I havent written
becouse it has not happened
I still swirl around inside
I lurk behind her actions
here is my home here i live
trough all her emotions
