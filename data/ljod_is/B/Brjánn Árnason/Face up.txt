Face up

I wait for the gatekeeper slowly 
with a pure haert 
I blindfold my concience
with the blood from my vains
I reach for my throat
to save it and to strangle it
I put on my tefflon suit
and stand face up in the storm
I wait for the liquid swords
to pierce through my heart
I hope for the holder
to drop himself upun me 
Everything for nothing
and Im Still standing face up
I try to balance my fall
on the finly sharpened spikes
I know I was for somthing and my knowledge dies with me
I rush to take a peak
at my slowly festering bodily remains
I see them sinking into the soil
with their new meaning
Everything for nothing
and Im still standing face up
