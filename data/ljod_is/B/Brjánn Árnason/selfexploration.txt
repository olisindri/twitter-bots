selfexploration

I always had women left and right 
I faked afecction I held them tight
I always made sure they stay in sight
Love hated me with all its might

They left me this thing and i had a look
They thougt I was happy- No I was shook
They wanted back their haerts thatI took
Love was the title of this book

Love took life and stirred in a boul
Love had definitly changed my role
Love had filled my haert and soul
Love woke me up and made me hole
