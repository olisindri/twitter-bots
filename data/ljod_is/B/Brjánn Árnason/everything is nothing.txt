everything is nothing

What if I were everything
Everything that lives 
Everything that dies
What if I were nothing 
Nothing that lives
Nothing that dies
What if I could choose 
When to be everything 
When to be nothing
What if I could choose 
To have nothing 
To have everything
What if nothing were to choose
Nothing would be everything
Everything is everything
