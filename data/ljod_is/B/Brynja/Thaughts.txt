Thaughts

My thoughts are hiding
hiding somewhere in side
i seek for an answear
that i can not find
and thaught i look
i can not see
the shadow 
that lies over me
and now im dying
dying in the dark
why didn\'t i listen
listen before i was marked
cos\'death it market me
and now i can see
that shadow has swallowd me!
