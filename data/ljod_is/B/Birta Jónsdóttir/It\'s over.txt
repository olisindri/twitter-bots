It\'s over

It’s all slipping away

I said some things I shouldn’t have,
a reaction way to harsh
to the facts that now stare me in the face.

When I left you I was nearly in tears, 
cause you had confirmed my worst fears 
that after we were both set free 
I had lost a part of you and a part of me.

I felt I didn’t know you anymore
and partially it was right,
but I had no right to call you a whore,
it was an unfair fight.
