Blame me

No longer will I 
bare the shame
for trusting you. 
I am to blame

No longer will I 
take the pain
of loving you.
I am to blame

No longer can I 
play this game
of loving you.
I am to blame.

For the love and lust
cheats and distrust
I brought it all on
We\'ll always go wrong.

So now our game 
of love is through
Blame me
i just got, over you.
