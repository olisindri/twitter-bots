I\\\'ll remain yours

We had our ups and downs
but the sun always shone through, 
cause the darkness never could stand too much of the light.

Without the storm there can be no stillness in our hearts,
if it wasn?t for the clouds we couldn?t rest in the shade
and without the pouring rain there will be no morning dew. 
Cause all those little things play their little parts
I pray our love will never fade
because I know that there is no me without a touch of you.
