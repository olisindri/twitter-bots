No more regrets

Let me lift your name on high, 
oh Lord, give me strenght to stop asking, why?
Because I long to walk down your path
and throw away all my wrath,
though the path is narrow, your love stays strong, 
if I only stay close to you, I know I can\'t go wrong.
So please dear Lord let me follow in your steps,
so there can be no more regrets.
