Thank you for it all

After all is said and done,
you are the only one,
the only one who makes me feel this way
and here is what I have to say. 

You are the only one
who can make me feel this bad, 
the only one who\'s kicked me when I\'m sad.
And the only one
who has ever made me feel this mad!!

I wanna spit in your face,
for making me a disgrace.
Never gonna buy another lie
and you\'re never gonna see me cry, no more.

I see now, this is the best way,
and without you I will stay.
Cause now you have made me see
that you\'re so not right for me.

And I thank you for making me strong,
I?m just suprised it took so long.
But now I\'ve stopped being your whore,
cause I dont need you anymore.
	
So now I thank your for being so cruel,
from now on I will be nobodys fool.
And now I\'m saving all my love
for someone capable, of loving me too.
