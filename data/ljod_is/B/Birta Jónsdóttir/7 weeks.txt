7 weeks

As we awaited your arrival
something went terribly wrong.
Somewhere along the line
your heart missed a beat,
never to start again.

You lived within me 
for only 7 weeks,
but it was long enough 
for me to love you,
to long for you 
and miss you, 
now that you are gone.

I know I never met you
but I know that I can never forget you.
