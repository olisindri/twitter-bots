Brother

Brother, brother, don’t  reach for the sky
Live sober here on, I don’t want you to die
Sleepless nights and endless thoughts 
Never ending the worries your actions brought

Live on brother, I need you with me
To stay as you are, death won’t set you free
This world is alright if you give it a chance
Just stay away from the devils dance

Our father and mother would miss you so much
Not ever to feel your loving touch
please do it for them if not for you
my brother! Your death is far from due

Lastly what I want to say
Is that if your not going to stay
You wont go alone, I’ll follow you
and they will mourn not one, but two
