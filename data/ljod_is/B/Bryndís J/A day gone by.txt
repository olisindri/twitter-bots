A day gone by

Thinking while I lay upon the bed
These last few days I’ve been alittle sad
It seems for no reason at all
Maybe it will all just go away 
And then may be it’s here to stay

Tomorrow everything may well change
Though I don’t know which way i’ll go
I’ll leave this place and then they’ll see
That I was never meant to be
Anything else than a memorie
