The Private eye

There once was a very private eye
This eye could see beyond the sky
Making moments last forever
Binding ties that would not sever
Giving life to lifeless dreams
Where everything is what it seems

The eye refused to wear eyeglasses
wear them just to please the masses
for this creature had a vision
and what it saw was it’s decision
even purple days and dreamy nights
were a fraction of it’s unique sights

Though it at times felt like a fraud
For some it was the eye of god
Catching life at it’s very core
More beautiful than ever before
For what it gave, this private eye
It could never ever be a lie.
