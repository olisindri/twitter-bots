WHY??

Why?
Why is that little girl crying?

why?
Maybe because her fish died,
maybe because she’s grounded,
or maybe because her true love went away.

I know how she feels, her heart is empty,
nothing but sorrow.
There is nothing in this life that makes her happy,
nothing that makes that little girl smile.
Not since her man died last saturday.
He died in war, fighting for his contry, his rights,
he died, but he died as an hero,
and she will allways remember him as her hero.

Everynight she cries herself to sleep, until
the last tear falls down the cheek.
But shes so tired, tired of cryin,
tired of being alone,
loneliness..
thats what she know best.

so, one day she takes a gun out of her daddys drawer.
she holds it for a while, then she looks at a picture
of her man, an smiles, for the first time in weeks,
“ i’ll see you soon baby”
And then she pulls the tricker....
