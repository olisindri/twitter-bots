Saved by an Angel..

Baby all my life I’ve been searching for true love,
and i thought i would never find it, until i met you.
 I want you to know that you mean the world to me,
although i might not show it, but baby, i really do love you.

 You’re an angel sent for the sky to save me from all evil,
god really must love me, cause he sent his favourite angel to rescue this little girl.

And this little girl is me, 
her heart is broken in one tousand pieces,
she has really been heartbroken, 
trying to find the true love,
trying to find the man of her dreams.

But all these guys do for her is tell her they love her and then leave her
all alone, with a broken heart.

Then you came along, and you try to clue the pieces together,one by one.
And yesterday you did it, 
my heart is all healed,
and I know i love you, baby, 
you are the love of my life.


And all you have to do now to make me happy, is to hold me really tight,
and tell me that you love me, 
tell me that I’m yours, 
and  you will never ever leave me, because I really need you, 
im lost without you..
dont ever leave me,
promise?

I hope god will forgive me, im not sending his favorite angel back,
cause you’re mine now,  
and as long as you wont tell him where you are,
he’ll never know.

But one day i’ll have to send you back, because you’ve done your job,
you have saved that little girl 
from evil, from missery, 
and when  that day comes,
I will cry myself to sleep.

But you have to go, i understand, 
you have to save all these other little girls, 
all these other girls that are like me, with broken hearts.

But I will never forget you, 
my favourite angel, my baby,
and all the things you did for me, 
all the things you tought me, 
I will allways remember that.

Thanks for being there for me, 
thanks for understanding, 
just remember, i love you
and there will never be a place in my heart for anyone else but you...
