lone

bruised by life
hurt myself
what\'s the way
out of my hell

now i know
where i\'ve been
closed the door
couldn\'t handle the light

still i miss the warmth
i need the light
can i get there
what\'s the way

tired of the fight
stuck being perfect
breaking the frame
that\'s crucifying me

overdosing on normal
lost in the woods
darkness surrounds
but still provides

cut myself shaving
because i wanted to
drove into a wall
because i had to

needed to break through
