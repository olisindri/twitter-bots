Your silhouette

I walk down to the door and look up,
ur silhouette is in the window.
I feel relaxed,
i smile.
You walk past me and i feel your aftershave,
it brings back memorys.

But now when i look up to the window,
its not your silhouette.
When i walk the corridors,
your aftershave isnt there.

I keep on smiling,
i keep on thinking of you.

Im glad your gone,
but it still hurts.
I can move on now,
move away from you.

But i miss you....
