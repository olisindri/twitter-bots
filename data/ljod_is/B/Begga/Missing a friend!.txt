Missing a friend!

There ones vas a friend,
my best friend.
She was the one i could talk to,
the one i could trust.
But one day day she told me she had to go,
go descover the world.
I waited for her return.
A year went by,
i was still waiting.
Then it happend,
she came back.
I was thrilled,
so happy.
But in a flash that happiness was gone.
It wasnt the same.
Now i feel alone,
missing my friend.
The friend i waited a yer for.
