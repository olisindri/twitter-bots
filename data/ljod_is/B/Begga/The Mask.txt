The Mask

Im trapped in my own mind.
No one whants to know what is in there,
nobody cares.
I can scream it from a roof top but nobody listens.
My heart doesnt care any more,
my soul is too weak to fight it.
I have given up,
surrendered to it.
Cause the pain is to much for me to face it.
I have lost myself in the mask.
And i dont want to go back.
Im strong inside somwhere.
Im slipping away.
Away from me.
From the person i once was.
And in a twisted way it feels good!
