The Rock

I guess this is good by,
and a thank you.
For so long you have been there,
my rock in the sea.

My tears have flown,
in onor of you.
My smile has shined,
of the thought of you.

No longer am i allowed,
to think to our days.
No longer to smile,
of the thougt of you.

I hope you will be happy,
you realy deserve it.
I hope u think of me,
with a smile on our face.

Its time to let go,
move on.
But do one thing for me,
dont ever stop smiling.
