That night

The candle light in your eyes is burnt in my mind.
The look on your face is stuck in my eyes.
The touch of your skin is still on mine.
The smile on your face reflects my smile.
The beat of your heart plays like drums in my ear.
That night vil never leave my heart.
The night i knew..
