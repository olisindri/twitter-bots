Stupid love

Stupid.
Is that the word?
Is this the right word for love.
Love is stupid.
Love is so much.
Why do we fall in love,
when we only get hurt.
It\'s not a usual pain.
It\'s like your mind,
your soal and heart
are being stabbed.
Stabbed with thousund knives
Cutting your mind
You go insane.
You don\'t think right.
You\'re in love.
12 dosens of roses
a shiny golden ring.
Maybe couple of children,
is this all a fake?
Stupid?
That\'s the word for love,
that feeling you don\'t know,
but everybody want.
What can we do,
without falling in love?
Nothing, nothing at all.
Just sit down and think.
Is it worth it.
Stupid
that\'s the word
that\'s love.
