We\'ll meet again

I\'m all by myself
and I miss you alot.
Why did you go?
Why did the sea take you away from me.

I know I\'ll survife
I\'ll stay alife
I\'ll stand on my own
but I will always miss you.

When I think about the sea,
my eyes get full of tears
why did you do it?
why did you go?

When I look in a mirror
I think ,,I should go after him\",
but I can\'t do that
cause I know I gotta live.

I gotta finish my business
and when that is finished
cause I love you.
Though the death will do us apart
we\'ll always love eachother
so we\'ll meet again.
Soon in the ocean,
soon in the death,
soon in heaven.
