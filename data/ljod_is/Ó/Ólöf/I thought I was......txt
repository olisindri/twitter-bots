I thought I was.....

I thought I was sad.
I thought I was blue.
That the night would never end.
I went for a walk,
I saw everybody were happy.

I took the train,
everyone were quiet.
I thought I was alone,
alone, sad and blue.

But then I saw two children.
Almost no clothes,
and no hope for them.
I realised,
I was not alone,
I was nothing.
