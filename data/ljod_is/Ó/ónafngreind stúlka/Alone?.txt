Alone?

With a smile on your face,
You looked at me, full of grace
You said to me, I was the one
And so I thought I was your onlyone

But time went by,
And so did you
It was all a lie
Nothing was true.

So it seems to me again, 
Iâ€™m alone, left in pain
Will I ever find the one?
Is he there, is there someon
