The pain

So alone
But no-one knows.
All this pain
Started again
I scream for held
But no- one hears
My eyes are wet,
Iâ€™m all in tears. 
Then a hand comes towards me
Whipes away all my tears
I look up, and so I see
An angel smiling down to me
And so he takes my hand and says
I heard your scream,
I felt you pain
Come away with me, to another place
And you will never fell the pain again
