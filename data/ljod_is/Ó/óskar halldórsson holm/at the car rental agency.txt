at the car rental agency

what luck that i found you at work,
and your duty to smile you don\'t shirk
i deeply desired
what i saw and admired
but tried not act like a jerk.
 
from passion i tried to refrain,
ignoring a voice in my brain:
\"jump over that counter!
and then try to mount her!\"
my effort was -sadly- in vain.
 
me pardon for being so blunt
for dragging you into this stunt.
my heart may have yelled it
my eyes keenly smelled it
that you\'re a game worthy to hunt.
