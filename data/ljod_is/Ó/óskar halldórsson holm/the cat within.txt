the cat within

lazily roams the corridors
and rooms painted in dull memories.
alone she knows 
the fantasies, nightmares
and daydreams. 

asleep most of the time 
in the bright light  
of the closed windows
-while i pointlessly exist- 
but wakes to enjoy the tuna  
and to frolic in the lemon scented litterbox
which i leave out for her -hoping
that she exists, too.
