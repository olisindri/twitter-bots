Since the beginning of time
Erupting mountins have created lava
Glasiers have polished rocks
Rivers and waterfalls have carved canyons
Wind and rain have  moulded the landskape

What took nature millions of years to build
Takes us humans only a fracture of that time to 
..dig thru,
..blow up,
..tear down and even drown

 IsÂ´nt it just a matter of time when our land lord collect whats his?
God help us then, I pray.
