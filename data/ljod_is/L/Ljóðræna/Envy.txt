Envy

She emerges from the water.
Her naked, wet body shimmers in the sunlight.
I watch a drop of water slide down her chest,
down on to her breast.
It hesitates on her nipple...almost like it wants to stay there.
I get a tingeling feeling in my body,
and I realise, just how much
I envy that tiny drop of water
of itÂ´s journey down her body.
If I only could...
