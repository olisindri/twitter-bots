Tommorrow

Tomorrow he said
Tomorrow she gasped
Tomorrow we’ll sort out the problems of the future
Tomorrow your love will heal all my soars

Tomorrow I’ll live
Tomorrow I’ll learn
Tomorrow I’ll find us a new place called home
Tomorrow I’ll fill the empty spaces in your heart

....Tomorrow we’ll forget why we even thought of tomorrow in the first place
