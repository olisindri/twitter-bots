Frozen

The untouched
the pure
is the faerest of all

the frozen
the still
does not speak

if you go there
and listen you will
hear the call

the whisper
of the frozen
is pale and weak

the frozen
will sound
if silence is broken

the silence
of the sound
is struggling to hold

the outburst
will leave
the frozen, awoken

and all
that is living
will turn to cold
