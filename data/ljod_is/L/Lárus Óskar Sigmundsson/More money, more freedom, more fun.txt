More money, more freedom, more fun

I need freedom,you need fun 
we are dancing in the midnigthsun.
We are using it all everyday
In Herabalife, do it your way

Chorus:

In Herbalife, I got freedom
In Herbalife, I got my style
In Herbalife, I got my fun
In “Herbalife”

It’s cheap and nice food
Herbalife turns you in good mood
It’s healthy and gives you look
The Herbalife all my fat took

Chorus: 

Herbalife pills and bar you take 
Soya beans and protin shake 
We are using it all everyday 
In Herbalife, do it you way

Chorus:

We are using it all everyday 
In Herbalife(stopp), do it you way
