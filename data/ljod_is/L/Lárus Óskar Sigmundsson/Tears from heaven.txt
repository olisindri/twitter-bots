Tears from heaven

Erindi 1 

Blue moon, rising up 
To the sun up on the sky. 
Cloud’s dancing, don’t worry
I will save your live

Viðlag... 

I will see your angel dancing around
I will see your angel play with my smile
I will see you angel falling two tears 
Two tears from heaven
Tears from heaven

Erindi 2

I’m losing, my mind,
About you Jesus Krist
Angels coming,angels take me
To the sun up on the sky

Viðlag...

Gítarsóló
 
Viðlag...
