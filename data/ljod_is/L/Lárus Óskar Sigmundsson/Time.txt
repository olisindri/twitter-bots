Time

After all this time
I'm getting more lonely than ever
I wish you were mine
And we'll be together forever

I shut myself in a prison of loneliness
Where no one believes in true happiness
Where I'm getting a kind of faithless
I need to get out

Honey, I need you more than ever
I never realised it before
That we were ment to be together
I just could love you much more

But in a perfect plan
There's always an error
A lonely girl and a lonely man
Involved in emotion of terror

For you I would die
When I look into your eyes
Whenever you walk by
Oh, the pain, for you I will die

But a sorry story has been told
You made me kill myself
And for you, my soul I sold
And I'm dead and it's your fault

Even now when I'm dead
There are so many things left unsaid
So much pain in me
But still, I believe that you and me were ment to be
