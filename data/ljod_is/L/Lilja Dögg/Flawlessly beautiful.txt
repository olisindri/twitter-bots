Flawlessly beautiful

It’s a revelation this dream I had last night.
The fear has left my mind.
Revelation cause I haven’t felt like this in such a long time.
It’s strange how it keeps creeping
 Back in to my mind.
Today today.
 And everything is the same.
Tomorrow tomorrow.
And everything falls in to place.
Silently today becomes the past.
And I watch it fade away.
Will we meet tomorrow?
If it ever comes.
My crippled mind is in a sleepless coma.
And I’m not finding my feet
To checkout what’s happening to me.
And this time tomorrow you realize
You broke the rules.
Messed it up for the two of you.
