Down

Why did you not tell me you were sorry?
Why did you not tell me you understood?
When the sea is calming down.
And my emotions haven’t run you out.
Making me seam, the calmest of breeze. 
Pulling me down and out.
Letting go of my last breath
 Out my lungs.
Giving up on 
Present situation.
Seeing the end as the
 Best solution.
Now I will see tomorrow.
And know what you don’t.
Stop holding me down.
I have one million, things to let out.
