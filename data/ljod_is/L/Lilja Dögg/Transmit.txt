Transmit

Look to the sky.
White clouds embrace
I try to reinforce him.
This will be your time.
Is this your life?
Collapsing my shoulders.
My head moves down.
Flying through the air.
Emotionally transparent.
Transmit time
transmit.
Transparent to the eyes
the mind transmit
the truth.
My head moves upward.
The moon to see.
Transmitting sms.
Hello I want you to blaze the sky
find your eyes enlighten by the moon.
We are both in tuned.
Into the moon 
We send sms.
The moon speaking
until the next night.
