Forgive&forget

It’s easier to forgive
Than it is to forget.
 It’s so easier to fall back in
Than it is to stand up again.
 
Just so I can feel alright
This is the time
To look you in the eye’s
Say “goodbye”

Now I will never
 Let you down again.
I just don’t know if I fell.
Or just got up again.

Now you lost
That special thing you
 had before.
And I’m turning into ice 
When ever you are around.
Braking up is hard to do.
