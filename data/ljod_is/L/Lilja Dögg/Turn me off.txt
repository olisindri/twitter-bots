Turn me off

Everything is right
Then you turn me off.
Every song I sing
Turns me off.
Every breath I take
Breaks your lungs.
Turns you off.
It suck’s a lot
Fucks me up
Shit I’m drunk.
But to hell with it
Anyway.
 I feel sorry for you
Then you turn me on
Every smile I give 
Turns you on.
Every time you give to me
Turns you on.
But to hell with it anyway
Anyway.
You’re turning me on and off.
It suck’s a lot
And fuck´s me up.
 But I’m having fun.
So why are you turning me off
And on.
