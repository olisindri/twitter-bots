Mundu

Sometimes I wish the wind
Would not be cold.
Sometimes I wish I was on my own.
Would my heart beet still go on?
If I loose these feeling’s
 Will my mind still have its own?
 I don’t know how to fake it.
Nothing is here for my taking.
Feelings bring me pain and joy
But tears I can claim as my own
From things that were left alone
No one there to comfort
No one there to hold
The wind is cold
Hope and clarity 
That is what you are to me 
You are sanity
You are my sanity
