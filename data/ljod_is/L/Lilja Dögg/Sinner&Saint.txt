Sinner&Saint

Decent devil how have you been?
Still looking good man have a drink on me.
 Killing time by your side means so much to me.
Your life is all messed up.
Have you nothing to seek?
No necessity to bring?
Nothing left to cling on to?

You’re words aren’t deep enough.
Or def to my ears.
 They have no effect.
It’s a visual defect.
Or is it just me?

My thought’s still lay around.
Unused sometimes abused.
And still I have no clue.
 Shallow as a child I am.
Say something sexy.
Say you’ll stay.
That you won’t brake.
Say you will stay.
