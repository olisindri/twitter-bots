Madly

I can’t seem to think of no one place
Were you would hide.
No special taste comes to mind.
When I drift through all the echoes that were left behind
Steel all the tears you can find.
I don’t mind.
Embrace me love
You’re so kind.
Embrace my love
Take your time.
Embrace me love 
I won’t mind.
Know this it’s just you.
No one else will do.
So if you’re ever ready to come out
And I start walking.
Don’t run me down.
I have my feet firmly on the ground.
