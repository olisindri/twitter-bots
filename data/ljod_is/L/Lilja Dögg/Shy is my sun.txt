Shy is my sun

To err is human & covering up is to.
What is the secret of successful living?
I am growing in the wrong direction.
So far away from home.
He had some affection.
To some extension.
Now I am flourishing like a flower,
In some one else’s arms.
 Killing the game, makes him go away.
Playing it my way.
Shy is my sun.
And it’s not for you to see.
So don’t push so hard,
Because I feel like I am braking.
 After all that has been taken 
Out of me.
