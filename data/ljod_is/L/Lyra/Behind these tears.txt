Behind these tears

Behind these tears, Beneath this pain, 
A child who fears, Fighting in vain, 
Too many times he tried, 
Even blood he cried, 
He is dead inside, Still no one hears, 
No matter how far he goes, How loud he screams, 
All eyes are closed, They\'re dead it seems, 
May be death found to them a way, May be who knows, 
Or may be they didn\'t find a reason to stay, No one cares I suppose.
