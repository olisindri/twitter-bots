Before I Let the Pen Drop

In the darkness of the shadows, 
Lies my soul, 
Looking inside me,
There is only a hole, 
When the night falls,
My pain will rise again, 
Can\'t help it but give in,
Even death can\'t release me, 
I\'m already dead, 
Can\'t find a way to stop these voices in my head, 
Waiting between thousands of lives for someone can hear my within voice screaming,
I\'m not just a kid, 
Can\'t find myself, 
Lost in my thoughts, 
Confusion will end, 
Whatever it costs, 
Begging my eyes not to be cryin\', While writin\' my last line, 
Waiting for something to make me stop, 
Just before I let the pen drop, 
Here she comes looking at me,
Holding my hands to make me see, 
My hidden spirit, 
It seemed so true, 
Life is so beautiful if we only knew.
