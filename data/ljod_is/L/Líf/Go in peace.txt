Go in peace

Well I don’t wanna talk 

About the things we did 

I try to forget it all 

Well its just not meant to be 



My dear try to listen 

I haven’t found a new you 

But I had enough and im through 

Oh boy I don’t know what to do 


Common try to reashue me back to you 

But im not sure if it will do 


The things ,the time 

It just not right 

There is nothing here 

And it will never be 


Im sorry this will end up like this 

But if nothing else works 

I guess this will have to do 


Go in peace 

Think of me quitly in the night as you sleep 

I will stay in your dreams … 

Don’t you forget me..
