Feelings

You can always make me smile

And make me laugh.

You know me inside out 

You know my secrets

And you’r my friend 

It was supposed to stay that way

But something had changed.

 

Something happened in me 

I didn’t knew what it was

Something weird, some feelings

They struggled in my head

And my heart was beating fast.

I hoped that you feelt the same way 

Not sure of what answer I would get 

You said no and my heart fell in two.

As the time did go by

I got stronger feelings 

And didn’t knew what to do with them

Should I just try to threw them away.

Everything has changed now.
