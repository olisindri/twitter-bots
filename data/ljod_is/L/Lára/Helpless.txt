Helpless

She cries in the darkest corner
waiting in fear.
His strong arms, 
seem to conquer all.
She tries to run for freedom
but she’s too lost  and tired.
She fights her best
but he’s way too strong.
When will it end?
She’ll never know.
Her heart was a crushed shell
by the sole of his shoe.
