Dreaming

Iâ€™m waiting for you,
my friend
to come out of the skies.
Others have waited too,
then lost patience
but for me the time flies.

All the pretty birds
flying 
towards light of peace.
Running, elephants in herds
very loud
just like your niece.

Then I feel warm
sunshine
and the world is good.
All soldiers disarm
peace
poor children get food.

I wish for you
only you
with all my heart.
