BaseBall Game

Strike once, twice 
and then three times.
Ball!
Run, fast! Faster!
Don\'t stop,
for a breath.

Every minute
that you take,
cost\'s you
a whole life.
On this long road,
Never! Must you stop!

At the end,
we are all fools!
Running to the end.
Hoping to catch the ball.
Only hoping,
never knowing!
But in the end,
the ball is out.

Into a deep, dark hole,
falls the ball!
Humans are such a fools!
Running after it,
like dogs!
Time has won.
Now you must die.
