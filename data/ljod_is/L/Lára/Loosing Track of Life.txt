Loosing Track of Life

The power of death,
strikes us all, at least,
once in life.
Then new is born,
and we love,
life again.

Then we see,
the sorrow, of the pain,
that fills out closest hearts.
Love seems far away,
like it never was,
or will be again.

Death becomes the freedom,
and we leave,
to look for better.
But what do we find?
Only deeper and darker pain,
worse then ever seen.

Death and life,
Become one.
Love and loss 
don’t differ.
Where to go?
I don’t know.
