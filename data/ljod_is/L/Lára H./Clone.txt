Clone

I asked you over for dinner,
I said: Nice shoes!
Ignore was the answer
of the unconscious one.
And I spent lonely night,
crying, in my cold bed
Because all I wanted…
Was a FRIEND!

What was that?
“I thought you were different”
Who was I, when you were me?
My understanding,
reaching the limit
of the human illusion.

Don’t be me,
because who the fuck
am I then supposed to be?

At the start,
you were nice
But then you didn’t like me.
For who I was,
my idea, my opinion.
But why? I don’t understand
why you changes into
ME!

I cut myself
out of your sociality
My idea was Freedom,
but cloned was living you
not a mind of my own.
I need a friend!

Don’t be me,
because who the fuck
am I then supposed to be?
