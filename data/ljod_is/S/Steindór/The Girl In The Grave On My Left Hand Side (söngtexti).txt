The Girl In The Grave On My Left Hand Side (söngtexti)

The grass always seems to be
so much greener
on my neighbours grave
But he doesn’t have the view I’ve got,
Over on my left hand side
You see,
there’s
this
Really cute blond with a lovelyskeleton,
Just lying next to me

And the dirt around her smells so nice,
On her grave there are no rats or mice
She has only got one vice,
And that is she’s got lice
On her skull.

When I stroll around in the park of graves
I always follow her, in a haze
She has me in a daze
They say that Jesus saves

But they’re lying

In death the devil is your only hope for salvation

But I think I have found a new way to redemption

And that is

The girl in the grave on my left hand side

The girl in the grave on my left hand side
I keep looking at her, she’s sleeping so sweet
And the thigh bones are so beautifully shaped, the bones in her legs all are-all the way down to her feet

She has got the nicest shaped skull I have ever seen,
In a love affair with her the downsides that I can see are only one

And that downside is:

I was buried alive
