The first love

I feel the tears
go down my cheak
From my eyes
there is a leak
Cause you are gone
out of my life
And I don\'t know
if I\'ll survive

In my mind
I think of you
And all the things
that are so true
Noone can say
when end is near
Not even the ones
who see and hear

When I had troubles
you took my hand
And lead me through it
until the end
Remember the good times
I hear them say
And I think of the fun
we had in may

It won\'t stop the tears
I miss you so much
Cause you were mine
whom noone could touch
\"Now she\'s an angel\"
says my father
You were always an angel
you were my mother
