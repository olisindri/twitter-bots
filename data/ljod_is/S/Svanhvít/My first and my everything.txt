My first and my everything

This is a little lovepoem,
only for your eyes.
Cause I have a special love for you,
a love that never dies.

It started with a little crush,
but early began to grow.
Until it was so really big,
it was hard not to let it show.

It brought us together one lovely night,
to forget it I never will.
Cause the moon was full and the stars shined bright,
and the wind was completely still.

Now we\'ve been one for a while or so,
and our hearts, they beat together.
With this poem I just want you to know,
I\'ll love you forever and ever.
