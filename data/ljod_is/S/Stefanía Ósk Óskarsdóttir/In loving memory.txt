In loving memory

My soul is weakened by your touch,
My heart exposed by your kiss,
I am devoted to you.

And as the sun sets
And your fire dies;
With it I shall also
For I am one with you
My darling,
And forever shall our love remain,
When everything else is forgotten
I will remember you, my love
And so we shall live forever:
In loving memory.
