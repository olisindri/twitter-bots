Farewell

It is without hope
That I say goodbye to you.
Without freedom
That I question your love.
Lust has poisoned my mind
And with it I shall die.
But do not cry me, my baby
For I will always love you
Through heaven and hell
Good and bad
Until all opposites collide
And everything crashes.
There will be nothing but us,
So I bid you farewell
My dearest,
With hope, with freedom
always.
