Only you

Closing in on me,
The shade of my soulless past,
Try to forget
But my heart’s beating way too fast.
I love you,
All these voices in my head.
You love me,
So why all those tears I need to shed?
Why do you hurt me?
How can you live with my mistakes,
Do you need me?
Cause without you
My whole heart begins to ache.
How can you miss me,
When I’m only one step away?
Don’t get me wrong,
I do want you to stay
How can I love you,
With all this pain you put me through?
I’ll never be strong enough,
But baby there’s only you.
