December Rain

Will I forever walk this road,
When will I see the light?
I feel your hand is slipping
The hand I held so tight.
The moon is swiftly fading,
My sky turns into gray,
I see you up there waiting?
Will I ever be the same.

I have no hope, no freedome
I'm trapped inside this cage,
I wish that I could miss you
But all I feel is rage.
If only I were brave enough
To see through all this pain
My eyes are sinking slowly
In misty december rain
