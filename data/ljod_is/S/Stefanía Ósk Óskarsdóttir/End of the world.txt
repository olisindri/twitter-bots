End of the world

Standing on the edge of the world
Our hands clasped so tight,
Our eyes focused on only this
On only the fading dream.

One jump away from eternity,
One step closer to you.
How many tears does it take
To have you just one more time.

I gave you my heart
At the end of the world
And you shall forever hold it
So our love can remain.

Our last kiss of faith
The warmth of your chest
Fingers wrapped together
As we make our final jump

Always to believe
Never to let go
Forever
