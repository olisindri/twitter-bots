Remember me

Remember how we used to play,
The smiles we used to share?
Remember all the ruthless nights
Our laughs and endless love?
Remember it when all our hope is lost

Remember how you said to me
That this would never end?
Remember all our promises
Our fights and sweet goodbyes
Remember it when all your hope is lost.

Remember when Iâ€™de comfort you
Through dark and dreadful times
Remember how you helped me through
My loss of faith and freedome
Remember it when all my hope is lost.

Remember what I tell you now 
That I am always yours
Remember this my last goodbye
My neverending words
Remember me and I shall never die
