.

Its me, the buzz you hear on warm summernights
the ladybug sitting on your porch
Its me, waching you when you turn out the lights
the shaddow cast from no tourch

Its me, whistling songs in your ear when your lockt up in fright
the wind pulling you into various games
Its me, putting words to your mouth starting a fight
the anger running through your vains
