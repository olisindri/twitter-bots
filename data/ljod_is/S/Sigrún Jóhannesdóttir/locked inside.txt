locked inside

im locked behind bars colder than steel
yet it is me that holds the key
but somehow it seems i cant let myself out
'couse in my heart there remains a doubt
help me out

i seem to have lost the way to love
pleace angels surround me come from above
this silence is killing me, its just to loud
i crawl under a blanked and in sleep i should
help me out

all i feel is empty im washed inside 
in the darkness of my sell must i forever hide?
allways im lonly, even in the biggest crowd
tell me what is this happyness all about? 
help me out
get me out
