Have you seen the morning Rose
her tenderness every wher she goes
Have you seen her smiling face 
her lovely eyes and gentle embrase.

Have you noticed how she walks
and have you listened how she talks
When the afternoon sun goes down 
her grace is still around.

When the evenings shadows grow
her charming delight start to glow 
Then she whispers in the wind 
loving me can never be a sin

In the heat of the darkest night 
she lies her body by his sight 
and gladly gives him all her love 
the morning Rose and the stars above.
