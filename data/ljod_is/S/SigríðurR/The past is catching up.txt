The past is catching up

Empty soul
Empty head
The lonely child is lying in bed
Cries at night, 
But no one hears
The cry of help, 
Behind these tears.

It once was happy and laughed alot
But this sadness inside is all it got
The lonely child wants to be free
The lonely child lives inside me
