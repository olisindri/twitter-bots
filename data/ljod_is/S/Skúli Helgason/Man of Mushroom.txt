Man of Mushroom

All around I ate my date
My stash my state
The needs calling late
But you know, I gotta catch that flight

All around, I ate my skunk
My fur my funk
As drunken punk
But you know I’m higher that a kite

All around my body I’m soaked
I’m brushed, I’m broke
That chunky will choke
Along with the moment of clarity

All around I strut my stuff
My bad my bluff
My sniff my snuff
Along with the moment of ecstasy

Damn, Damn again
My eyes lid up, I’m on sinkin’ sand

Damn, Damn again
Mushroom man is here to take my hand

As I sin
For the state I’m in 
Nor loose or win
I feed my soul

You runt
cheesy cunt
Place your punt
I’m on a role

Hate me, ate me, eat me, beat me
Freak me, weak me, will me, kill me
Rip me, zip me, love me, let me go

Damn, Damn again
My eyes lid up, I’m on sinkin’ sand

Damn, Damn again
Mushroom man is here to take my hand

As you heard, 
Heard my word, 
So absurd 
Facing down

As I fake
More I can take
Shiver and shake
Hit the ground

Hate me, ate me, eat me, beat me
Freak me, weak me, will me, kill me
Rip me, zip me, love me, let me go
