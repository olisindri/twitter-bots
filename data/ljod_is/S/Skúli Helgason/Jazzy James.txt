Jazzy James

This is the story About one man´s fame
Who took my manhood and stained my name
I caught him at home messing with my girl
I lost my breath, my mind started to swirl
Rippin hert burst in raging flames 
Cuz i lost my love to a man called Jazzy James

Get of my Lady 
Get of my Lady

But she just screamed
Screamed his name
Jazzy James

It hurts when the sun is ripped from your sky
You fill your chamber, bullets starts to fly
The painfull sight of naked bodies in bed
I couldn´t forgive so i painted them red
My filthy love is never coming back 
Cuz Jazzy turned my world, my world to black

My world is Shady
My world is Shady

So i caught a bullet
Bullet myself
