Grenade

I should´ve seen
When you sold my spleen
Something was wrong
When my appendix was gone
I wanna get out see the sun
But they´re all after me with a gun

Hypochondria
Hypochondria
It´s what´s wrong with me

Private voices calling
Tell i´ll crumble i´m falling
But they´re only in my head
I´ll bleed out in my bed
The world stops to gyrate
with a fall of a grenade

I got hole in my soul
keeping me from reaching my goal

I got a soul in my head 
And it´s trying - dying dead
