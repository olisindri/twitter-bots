The Saviour

When i feel alone, my mind goes across the sea
To think of you my sister so far away from me
You were my shelter, you are my rock
We can be without allt he modern talk
And i know life was a bitch
But you always protected me when we were kids
Don´t look back in anger there is one thing good
You helped me survive our fucked up childhood
You saved my life, and if i could
I´d do it for you everyday, but you know i would

You rised me up when i was down
So it gets hard not having you around
It gets harder when winter is growing colder
When i just wanna lay my head upon your shoulder

All my life i´ve been in my own prison
And you were the only one who would really listen
You are my saviour, you are my muse 
When i´ve got you in my heart i know i can´t lose
So it´s the question what did i do
To get the privilege, to be the only one really knowing you
I quess we´ve lerned from the weeping wound from our father
And the wounds get salty the times he won´t even bother
But today you are a good mother
It don´t matter how old i get i´ll always be your little brother

You rised me up when i was down
So it gets hard not having you around
It gets harder when winter is growing colder
When i just wanna lay my head upon your shoulder
