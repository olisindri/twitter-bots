God Is A Bastard (As I Am A Tree)

I died from thinkin the ultimate thought
I was the child god forgot
No one was there to pick me up 
The reaper was on a vacation that day
Down in the grave i called lord on the phone
I pushed all the buttons but there were no such zone
He lived in a shoe on a cloud made of stone 
I called him again but no one was home
I sued the bastard,and then offered a plea
I wanted a rose but grew back as a tree
