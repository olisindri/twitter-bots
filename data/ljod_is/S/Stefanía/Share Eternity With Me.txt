Share Eternity With Me

In your place of safety
Wait for me
Bleed for me
I will be there to collect your soul
I will be there to take you home

In my realm of reality
Come to me
Roam with me
Together we make darkness light
Together fade into the night

In my room of darkness
Together
Forever
Together we shall be
Forever you and me
