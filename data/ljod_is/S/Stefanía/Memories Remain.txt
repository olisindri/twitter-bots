Memories Remain

She talks to herself
She talks to the TV
She talks of the things
She can no longer see

She is always at home
And she’s always lonely
She prays every day 
to have some company

she has grown very old
year by year always cold
her whole life has been sold
she’s got no one to hold

she’s been left all alone to mold

forsaken, abandoned,
imagine her pain.
She sits by the window
Admiring the rain

And only her memories will remain
