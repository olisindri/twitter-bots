Sms st√∂kur

You're my best friend,
And I know it's true.
That in the end,
I'd be helpless without you.

I love you and you know it,
to bad I just can't show it.

I love it when you're there for me,
And I love it when you smile.
I love it when it's just you and me,
though we've just been mates for a while.

You mean the world to me,
You know it's true.
I thought you could see,
without you I'm blue.
