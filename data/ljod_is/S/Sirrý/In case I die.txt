In case I die

I wish I could think of something
to tell you how I feel.
You will probably never know,
How much I really care.
But after I die,
I hope you'll think:
"Oh, I wish S.S. was here"
Please don't cry,
I'm not that important
and crying won't make it better.
I'll be watching you from heaven
no matter where you go.
You know you mean the world to me
I don't know if you feel the same.
But if you do, please let me know, 
the game of love,
is everything but a game.
