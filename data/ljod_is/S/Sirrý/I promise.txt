I promise

If you only knew,
Of all the hurt and pain
you've cost me.
If you only knew,
Of all the scars in my soul.

You wouldn't treat me like you do,
You wouldn't make me cry.
You would say 'I love you' 
Or at least you would try.

I pray you soon will realise,
that after this.
It won't be the same,
I hope you soon will see that,
you-
 you're the only one to blame.

You won't treat me like you do,
You won't make me cry.
You won't say 'I love you'
You won't even try.

I promise that I'll tell her,
tell her,
what you did.
I assure you she won't want you,
never want you after this.

She won't treat you like she does,
She'll make you cry.
She won't say 'I love you'
She won't want to try.

I told you not to rape me,
and I told you not to lie.
She'll find out about everything,
and why I had to die.

My soul will come back to haunt you,
and there's nothing you can do.
You took my perfect life from me,
now I'm taking yours from you.
