Something in me

There is something in me,
And I'm wondering if it's true.
That this something in me,
Could also be found in you.

There's something in me,
That makes me look at the stars above.
And that something in me,
Makes me believe that I'm in love.

There's something in me,
And now it's stronger than ever before.
And that something in me,
Says that I'll never need you more.

There's something in me,
that makes me wonder why we're apart.
But that something in me,
Dries the teardrops in my heart.

There's something in me,
That makes me feel I don't have to pretend.
And that something in me,
will be here until the end.
