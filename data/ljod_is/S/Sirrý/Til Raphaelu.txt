Til Raphaelu

So, I was asked to write a poem,
especially for you.
I´m hoping that you'll like it,
so tell me if you do.
Well I hardly even know you, 
but I´m hoping that won't last.
'Cause we've really only got a month
to get to know each other fast.
I know that we'll have fun togher 
but the question really is:
Will we be friends for just two days,
or forever after this?
