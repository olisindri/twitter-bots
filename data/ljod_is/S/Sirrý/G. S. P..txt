G. S. P.

I wish you were here,
To keep me warm through the night.
I wish you were near,
So you could hold me tight.

I miss you so much,
And everything you do.
I mostly miss your touch,
And how you always knew.

I need the sound of your voice,
to tell me I'm ok.
I need to have the choice,
me tomorrow - you today.
