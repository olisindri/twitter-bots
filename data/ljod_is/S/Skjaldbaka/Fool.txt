Fool

You said you loved me, and I felt it to
But something changed in you
The next day you didnâ€™t want me any more

You said baby lets just be friends 
for now
I am not ready for this kind of commitment
Maybe later I will be ready 

And now many years later I am still waiting 
like a fool for you
just waiting for a call from you
saying that you miss me 
and you want me now.
