One of those days

One of those days.


Today is like one of those days. 

The day I am not set to amaze.
The day that turns into a phase.
The day I don't feel strong
The day  I don't feel I belong.
The day I get hopeless,
The day I get restless
The day I cant see forward.
The day my hope fades,
The day my beliefs waits.
The day I forget why
The day I just want to die.

 It's one of those days 

When my spirit is on the low,
When I cant remember how
When I feel like I'm just about to fall,
When I don't know who to call.
When I hope for a better tomorrow,
When I want someone else's life to borrow. 

It's one of those days 

I just hang around at home,
I turn off my phone.
I push everyone away.
I isolate myself to cause no harm
Its like sending myself to abandoned farm. 

I am afraid of saying something wrong,
I am afraid I wont belong.
I am afraid of loosing my friends,
I am afraid no one will  understand
I just push them all away and wait. 

Those days have turned into weeks,
Those weeks are becoming months.
Those days are becoming so long.
Those days go on and on.

With everyday going by,
My heart and soul says hi!
In hope of my spirit ever to knowledge,
In hope for my recovery. 

Maybe this day will be different,
Where everything gets back to normal
When I finally remember why.
 Maybe this is the day
I sit from my bed and say, yes!
"Now I know, now I remember!"
Its just like last September,
When I was chasing my dreams
When I knew my means. 

But today is one of those days.
Where my heart plays tricks,
The game called hide and seek,
Shame on you, peek apoo...
"I cant find you, where are you?" 
"Use you brain.. fool
when I'm lost, go find me!
Look into your soul,
If I'm lost, where would I be?" 

Inside I scream for help
But with out knowing why,
I close my eyes and hope for it to go by.

It's just one of those days. 


Supriya.
