Braveheart

Why is my mind filled with doubts?
Why am I questioning my abouts?
Why are my guts just up in a binge?
Why is my Braveheart falling to an inch? 

What is at the end of that door?
Will I be happy or will I be sore?
Will I be the star of success?
Will I be the fool who accomplishes less? 

Is there a reason for my fear?
Is the end of the era coming near?
Should I shout or should I scream?
Or should I follow and chaise my dream? 

All I have are questions and doubts.
The reason might be my big abouts.
I wont take less when I can take more
I wont be the person with the heart sore.
 
I guess I don't need the good luck speech. 
All I need is my own unleash.
I need to believe in my strengths
It will take me to the longest lengths.  

The real Braveheart goes and faces its fears.
It goes along despite the tears.
 It keeps on the path until life is clear.
It wont say "no, the end is near".   


Braveheart I am and Braveheart I'll be.
