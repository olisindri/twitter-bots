Lost love.

Those moments we miss
The kisses, the sex. 
Those lips I long to kiss. 
Why are things this complex?

Is happily ever after the case? 
Or is this just a phase? 
Feelings change
Plans rearrange.
But underneath it all
For you I always fall.

With you I feel complete. 
With you I feel i succeed. 
With you I feel never alone
With you I feel like home.
