Home

Home is where I want to stay
A place with no fear or obey
A home is where I will belong
A place I know I’m loved among
 
A home is where I need no pretend 
A place where rules I can bend
A home is where the pressure is none
A place I can go and need no fun 

A home is keeping the Sundays bread
The place my children want to be fed.
A home is where my dreams come true
A place I own and no rent is due

A home is someplace I don’t know where
A place I need so badly
A home is somewhere I feel the care
A place I fear so madly  

My home is gone and I feel the loss
My place I want for both of us 
Our home is where we both belong
A place we are both loved among.
