Murder

wash my hands
the blood is dry
I killed my best friend
now alone I cry
It seemed right at the time
now in hell I will fry
He stood by me in fire and rain
and now all thats left is an ugly stain
the bloodsplatter on my shirt
a reminder of the drugs and the pain
I cared for the bastard 
just like a brother
now I have to whipe the tears
of his heartbroken mother
his dad would have been proud
given him a prize
for being honest and uncruel
not judging by the size
of his mind but his heart
the clearest one I knew
went way of the chart
but I was so weak
to drugs then I seek
had a funky line
didn’t sleep for a week
the sky was yellow
the ground was so blue
I looked down and said
wow, where is my shoe?
I was fucked up
but you were just you
I freaked out and thought
you stole my shoe
I pushed you in a corner
and picked up a gun
splattered youre face
and now I’m on the run
escape reality
I hate to be so bad
but all I do is drugs
thats not bad, that is sad
so cold and so lonely
I pushed you away
made a hole in youre family
theres nothing I can say
to make everything alright
I won’t make it another day
I’m to scared to die
can’t turn myself in
they can’t understand
this ultimate sin
to take another mans life
you hardly need to bother
but to kill youre best friend
is 10 times worse then the other
I cant do this man
I don’t care about the fucking shoe
theres just one thing I need
I don’t need drugs, I need to be with you
