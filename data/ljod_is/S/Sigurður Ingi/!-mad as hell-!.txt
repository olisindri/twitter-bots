!-mad as hell-!

I ain’t thinking when I write man what the fuck
I ain’t got no talent, I guess its all about luck
and when your face is all red like you been hit by a truck
don’t come to my doorstep preaching about why we suck
we are all the same, we all want the fame
but some of us cant cut it, because we wont play the game
some won’t risk being exposed to all the shame
but they keep forgeting the fact that we’re the same
did you hear that, oops I made a mistake
I repeated myself but that don’t mean I’m fake
no, I silenced myself because I know what I can take
my vision of this life is not what you get but what you take
now its getting hardcore, I flamed the last thread
I’m getting ready to fight like my fists were made of lead
but I must wait my time, I sitting in line and not getting ahead
still very much alive and not nearly going dead
you want to hear some more, then change to channel four
and hope for some companionship, when I come knocking on the door
because when I’m through with you, all you can see is the fucking floor
wheeping the next morning because your face is all bloody and soar
yeah I know, life isn’t easy, it’s really really hard
here, go buy youreself some happiness with my creditcard
I tried it once but all I got was a fucking shard
of the truth that you would really fuck my up, without a regard
to my feelings or my soul, like I said just before
its what you take but not get, need I say it once more
cause you cant see the warnings, it’s like you just want the gore
the splatter of a insult when it hurts the deepest core
so now what? you expect me to cry?
just hand in the towel without giving this a try
this  ain’t that easy, you can’t just lay down and die
there’s always someone who cares and they’ll ask “why?”
and who’s gonna answer them? you? I don’t think so
what? you think you got what it takes, ohh hell no
just pack up your bags and leave, ok? go
or you could hang around and learn some stuff yo
I could teach you some shit, untill you come around
that every battle is a fight for the showdown
don’t punch ‘till the bell rings and you hear the sound
all you gotta do is hang in there and wait for the !-next round-!
