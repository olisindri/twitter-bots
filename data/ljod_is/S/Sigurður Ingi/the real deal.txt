the real deal

when you don’t know were to turn
and you’re sick of it all
just pick up that phone
and give me a call

I’ll wipe away the tears
make the problem dissapear
turn darkness to light
scare away the fear

I promise you’ll be safe
you don’t need to be alone
won’t let nobody hurt you
won’t leave you on your own

when you are in need
you can count on me
I won’t let you down
this you will see

because I’m a real friend
to whom treat me like such
and I trust you believe me when I say
that I love you very much
