dead

Life is a present
Death is a gift
both look alike
over so swift
count to ten
and suddenly then
will you remember the truth
you can’t do this again
time is of the essence
left only a few
breathing so heavily
reacting to the cue
of machines that pump air
through you’re lungs and you’re brain
“Can’t live on my own?”
going insane
tortured ,you fight
through the whole night
streaming you’re face
you see the light
moving in for the final 
and relentless sleep
this isn’t a dream
you take the leap
into oblivion
falling, you feel a bit sceared
on too a cloud
brilliant, not feared
hover to heaven
family in tears
