Blood

You wanna die? Ok
Pick a very popular, public place
So you can see the disgrace
in you’re mothers face
when she see’s you in a pool 
of her very own blood
Remembering you
when you we’re just a litlie kid 
playing in the mudd
throwing some sand
at the children all around
then you see youre mom
Wait, think....
What am I saying like you would listen to my crap
even if it made sense
maybe I’ll just stop writing
Locking you all out of the world that I see
Would you wanna be me?
Rather then youreself again?
I don’t think so
