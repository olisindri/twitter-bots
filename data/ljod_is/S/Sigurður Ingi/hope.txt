hope

man, why you still here
you sould be long gone
refusing the spark
is clearly wrong
but it isn’t my fault
I’m just being me
so what the fuck
am I suppose to be
clearly I cant be honest
because you wouldn’t accept
the real to be real
and pay me my dept
I’we felt this to long
and it’s burning deeper
to the insuccsesfull question
why I cant leave her?
round and round
the ring still goes
smoked and tweeked
amidst the rows
I’m getting lost
almost forgotten
bury me deep
so I can go rotten
a black mirage
a smokey reflection
of falling for hope
getting rejection
