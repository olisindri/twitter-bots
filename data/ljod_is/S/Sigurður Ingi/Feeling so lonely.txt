Feeling so lonely

Feeling so lonely, feeling so down
Feeling, oh feeling, this feeling is pain
Nobody see\'s me like I’ve never been known
If I continue like this , I’ll go fucking insane

Bringing it up and down, bringing it all around
Can’t stand too hear my own sound
Trying to mute it but nothing will work
Keeping these feelings they already lurk

From deep within me, I hear myself cry
Telling myself I’m living a lie
Want to get out, hear myself shout
Up to the sky and into the clouds

Far from behind, you see me try
Walking alone, talking to no one
But you can’t really see it,you only try
Still walking alone... I am alone....
