HEART

All day I sit by myself
thinking of escaping
Look at the people, they try
but they’re faking
Look to the sky
realise this
What you see is a cloud
not a flying dish
Run from reality
Run really fast
Sense you’re alone
but still you are last
Mist in my eyes 
I can’t see clearly
You’re holding my hand
but I know I will fall,
surely.....
But frightened I’m not
of falling for you
Because I know that I do
I really, really love you
Forest is chasing me
Wild side taking over
Then I wake up the next morning
Wishing I was sober
Unleash the knot
set me free
I can’t remember the name
It’s called L-O-V-E
From L comes the Life
wich I absorb and breath
The O is Obscured,
my image, when not freed
V is for Violence
I would fight for you’re heart
And E stands for Everyone
Because everyone has got a
HEART!
