Everyone

Everyone looks
but no one see’s
All the pain and suffering
hiding inside of me

Everyone walked
on my soul
No one noticed it
even if I’m foul

Everyone talks
like I’m not really there
But I’n used to shit like that 
so I don’t really care

Everyone heard
so no one said
When I scream out in pain
the memory fague

Everyone’s a winner
nobody looses
I’m just a looser
with too many faces

Everyone pushes
but nobody pulls
I can’t hide myself
with all these rules
