Forever

burning desire
to touch what isnÂ´t yours
sneak around freindly
doing all the chores
hoping that one day
you can make it yours
like finding a broken bottle
washed up on the shores

put the pieces together
keeping youre course
taping and gluing
using the force
the power that you have been given
this extraordinary force
one bill to pay for it all
you have to use it without remorse

so you fix the bottle
put it together
hoping that it will stick like this
even as long as forever
you pay the bill
youre skin turns to leather
but youre burning desire stays
its gonna be there forever
