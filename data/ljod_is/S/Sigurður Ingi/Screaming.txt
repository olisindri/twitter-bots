Screaming

Bringing out the worst in me
Trying to create something new
It won’t really make a diffrence
and no one will remember
except for a few
of those ignorant of the big things in life
like having a house, kid and a wife
This makes no sense,
all scrambled I wander
within my own fence
were I can enjoy not hearing you
but screaming it all back
you don’t really hear it
and that is a fact
I’m screaming right now
pleasure... resist...
smite me down 
and abandon me in the mist
I search for this
I search for that
I search for nothing
that is phaaty phat
3 years in a row
I was wearing a hat
shielding from you
and the others that fight
struggling to survive
with all my might
I was weak
but now only torn
when I die
you need not mourn
I will always be with you
SCREAMING!
