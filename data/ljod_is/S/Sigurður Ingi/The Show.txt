The Show

Me? I’m a man
and therefor a fan
of the music in our life
that we can’t understand

People and feelings
they rarely mix
hurting our problems
this we must fix

Screaming and shouting
but nobody hears
that the noise that we bring
are really some cheers

To this band we yeall “Anchor”
they play from their spirit
never heard of stage fright
and certainly don’t fear it

Like scissors cut paper
they slash all their strings
the drummer hits the set
their all doing new things

We listen to the music
emotions from tones
fuck those who don’t feel it
their hearts made of stones

Bringing back memories
reminding us to feel
music shows you only one thing
how to define what is real
