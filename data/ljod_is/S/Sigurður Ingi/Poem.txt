Poem

this is not a poem
but a letter
to a person who is herself 
and misjudged

and I’m gonna show’em
who’s better
by trying to be myself
misjudging myself

the way that I do it
is to be not heartbroken
and push all away
that is not the way

being amongst everyone
is hard by itself
but being youreself amongst everyone
is the hardest of them all

showing emotions, that no one should see
every one laughs at the man
who shows his emotion, that way killing him down
until he is no longer a man
