written in bones

a brand new sheet
life and existance
hopes and dreams
a futal resistance
how many yards
for a safe distance
this all disapears
in the next instance

cant stop me now
Iâ€™m unstopable
rich of feelings
highly affordable
channeling out
meaning of capable
rusty within
not nearly replaceable

finding peace
in ending and rest
wishfully thinking
this will end up the best
a heart of hope
beats within this chest
studying to pass
the final and last test

choosing visely
who to love and who to hate
still not knowing
the big pre-release date
leaving it all
in hands called fate
answers must come
hopefully not to late
