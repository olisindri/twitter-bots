New-born

Making me feel
like I’ve never been born
feeling like a child
that has yet not worn
the truth about life
the dreadful disease
killing everyone around you
bringing you to youre knees
the mistakes are as follow
you lived youre life
nobody cares
so drop the fucking knife
killing youreself
won’t solve a thing
look at the moon
you start to change
turning dark
look a the clock it’s almost noon
Oh my god
you’re already late
to witness the birth of the first born child
in youre hands, lies his fate
