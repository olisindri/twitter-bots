Alone...

Alone...
Everyones gone, yet here I stand
Alone...
Standing here staring at my hand
Alone...
My hand, the only one without a ring around my finger
Alone...
Expectations broken, now the shadows start to linger
Alone...
I wish the sun would shine, and make them go away
Alone...
Sitting in a corner, my inner self begging me to stay
Alone...
I talk to none, but myself
Alone...
No not talk, more like thinking to myself
Alone...
Repeat, depression, repeat
Alone...
You read this thinking this is deep
Alone...
This is the begining, the surface of it all
Alone...
You can´t imagine answering the one and only call
Alone...
But I try...
Alone...
Try to lift up the phone...
Alone...
I answer it “Hello” but realise I’m...
...Alone
