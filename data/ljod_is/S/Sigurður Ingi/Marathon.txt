Marathon

why so lonely,
but still alive
all so phony, 
I take a dive

they say that they read this
but all they do is look
if they say they can relate
then why dont they get the hook

I know this is stupid
I know this is dumb
but then I see you
and you are on the run

they all look back and laugh
hipocritic look in their faces
when I notice and laugh
they forgot to tie their shoe laces

while they run and fall, again and again
I quietly walk slowly in my own pace
they run and they fall, feeling pain
I won’t be discouraged, I will not go in vain

because I will finish to, but with more respect
for the trees and soil that I enjoied on the way
only time they noticed the soil, for a fact
is when they were falling and hitting it all day

they end up messy and dirt in their hair
they need assistance, they need a shover
I end up clean, not a spot on my shoulder
while they take a shover, I think it is fair
they will fall again, and hell will devouer
when I get to the gates of heaven
I’ll see a big smile, when they look at my folder
