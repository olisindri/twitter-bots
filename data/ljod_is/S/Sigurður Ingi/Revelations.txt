Revelations

Pealing the flesh
of the mind that is blowing
revealing thy self
without them ever knowing
I’m scared to hell
with all of these sessions
writing down all
my dirty litile confessions
putting in these lines
one thing that defines
the uglyness in all of us
my demise is my protection
fighting all of these copycats
they can’t cut through the bullshit
looking at their stats
discovering their misfits
