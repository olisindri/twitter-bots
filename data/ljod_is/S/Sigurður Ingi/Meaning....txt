Meaning...

For long I have not written
but here I go once more
talking about the things in life
reminding you once more
and you better listen if you want to learn a lesson
for this is an old confession
life is what you want it to be
no more no less
thats what I’m waiting for
no one seems to understand
the way they should restore
the style of love and hate apart
peace is uncomplete
nothing goes the only way
it was made to be
freaking out from underneath
you look to be amazed
see me crying under the bed
you see me fade away
and now I close this monolog
I dont know when I’ll be back
but you can rest and be not afraid
that I will be back
