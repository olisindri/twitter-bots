come in

fresh out of ashes
and into a new
an era of changes
chosen a few

more like itself
hidden in thought
chain reaction one
and two to be cought

the light the fire
lost in the shimmer
extinguishing sparks
beginning a winner

stalk the branches
shake the leafes
cut off the roots
taking down trees

evening is passed
sun will arise
uncovering truth
but also the lies
