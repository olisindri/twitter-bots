war

circles of extermination
killing our nation
army’s tanks
soldier’s Hank’s
blood leaking
peace seaking
killing people
for being able
to force oppinions
down on our minions
we fight
all the night
until the next day
like Jhon Lennon used to say
The war is over
say it with me once more
so we can stop spilling gore
of people who want happyness
because of this crapyness
drugs, money, hatred and the devil
this is all on the same level
in destroing our being
so we run away... fleeing
