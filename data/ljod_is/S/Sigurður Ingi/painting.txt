painting

I’m out on a field
blue sky on top
sweet sweet meadow
rain in a drop

a sun that shines
brings out the line
of hills and horizon
blending so fine

shimmering pond
with massives of life
a lotus and toads
along invisible roads

a big tree on a small hill
in the shadow lies a bull
rebuilding it’s fatigue
untill restored at full

your life is a painting
just like this
pencils and paper
paint as you wish
