the last goodbye

I look at the moon 
it is half just like me
listen to some music
hearing the sound

making emotions
trying too feel
comunicating through the tunic
trying to be found

writing with letters
you cant understand
the pain in my stomach
freehand, without land

I swim for the shore
nobodys waiting
everyone’s gone
everyone’s hating

feelings you show
I go down below
and laugh at the idiots
who fall into sorrow

searching through pages
searching for ages
never found affection
this is the last section

you’re reading the letters
but you cant see the words
the meaning of letters
is hidden in words

with tears in my eyes
I say my goodbyes
truly I’ll miss you
because I love you
