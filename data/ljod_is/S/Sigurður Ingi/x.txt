I hate to say this
but I love you still
this hole in my heart
I have to fill
sun sets down
over the hill
moon comes up
and shows its skill
under acheiving, just canâ€™t stop
progress of mind, I have to kill
connecting with no one
digging deeper, trying to drill
finding sadness
its name is ill
