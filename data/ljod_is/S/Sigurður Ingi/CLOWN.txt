CLOWN

Towing, towing & towing
towing towards something
Hoping, hoping & hoping
for just a glimpse
While everyone else’s soaking
the joy in this world
I’m sitting alone, writing
to the one who is you
Telling myself to keep hoping
but you don’t care
so why you keep faking
life is small, not fare
You enjoy all
While I sit here
you’re face stamped
on my eyelids
Hoping you’ll fall
and I’ll be there
catching you
but it’s only a dream
shattered and torn
I watch myself fall
and no one there to catch me
I fall and I hurt
no one to catch me
I hurt
a clown can’t hurt
can he?
