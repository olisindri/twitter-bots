throw it

put your head between your knees
because he doesn’t believe what he see’s
blocked by the future, he already knows
he can feel it from his head to his toes
what he will lose
will grow back
it takes time
to get back on track
so show some respect and try to stop interfeering
stop making noises and stop all the cheering
you can’t make it better, and that he gets
but still an unread letter, read it? lets

cought in the angst and broken between
how could this world get so mean
no it’s not you, no it’s not me
why oh why can’t I be free
making pictures from words and putting them into visions
taking charge of making your own decision
future lies in tragic alphabet and litile numbers
within reality it humbly slumbers
wake up the beast and you might get burned
so listen to this post and count what you have learned
breathing is easy, so are the words
put in emotions, see what you overheard
I worked hard, noting is free
you take everyting granted, even me
set fire to the case and hope that it disapears
suddenly your whiping away the tears
think with an act
don’t get cought up
make your way straight
up to the top
