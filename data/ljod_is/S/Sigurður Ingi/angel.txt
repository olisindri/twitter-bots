angel

angels are true
to those who believe
but don’t trust so easily
those who decieve

an angel is pure
fine and clean
but copys are dirty
ugly and mean

the angels have wings
they fly through the sky
and the ones who attempt
will fall down and die

the angels can sing
with melody dreams
don’t buy it all
it’s not all what it seems

angels are guardians
truthfull and just
for them to help you
belive in them you must

so if you see one of their kind
and you’re sure it is real
make a clear state of mind
get in touch with what you feel

show someone you must
you know what to do
can\'t show me the angel
I only see you
