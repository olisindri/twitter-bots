Scars

My skin is tearing
I got scars in my face
but they don’t reveal
what takes place
in this cruel litlie world
you better pick up the pace
start running and running
I succeed in not getting away
look at a person 
and try to realize
what it, he, she
is feeling 
Inside

I got the scars to show my soul
the way it really is
these scars represent
the things you think but don’t dare to say
to say youre feelings are like suicide
afraid to run, but barely can stay
avoiding the subject of opening you’re soul
keep it up, in the end you’ll be just like a ghoul
wandering the wastelands, looking for something,
but mostly youreself
you pick up a shovel and star to dig
you dig and you dig
at the bottom of it all
you see what you have done to youre soul
you’ve destroied it
and all that is left
is a gigantic hole
