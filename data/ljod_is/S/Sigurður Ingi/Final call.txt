Final call

with my mind in the trenches
I bend over the ground
the soil my ancestors said
that they had first of all found
bring justice to all
who are ready or unsure
of wich of them should fall
I let out the final call
let us move
the train will soon leave
better have you’re ticket
packed up in you’re sleave
like a con man
trying to decide
if he should rob for the money
or another dose of blood to his brain
so he can clear out things he is relly trying to hide
but first he must find the ticket for the ride
there it goes, you mist the train, and now you’re gonna die
the beast swells within you
you spin in all directions
losing all these feelings
don’t forget affection
wich to choose
heaven or hell
hotel room of luxury 
or this stinking litile cell
not to notice anyone
but the creeps that are around
cellmates or waitors
they are everywere to be found
this one wants to punch you
that one wants to kick
either way, we all ge our chanse
to but through you a dirty stinging stick
justice as before, will be caried out be us
judgement for you, as we see it to be fit
the sins you’ve commited, the crimes you have done
forgivness is for loosers, I find it hard, just a bit
but this is not reality
this is just a dream
wake up, WAKE UP!
and get ready to redeem
the letter you are reading
is a reminder to us all
that we are always thinking and deciding
who’s ready and who’s not to take the final fall
