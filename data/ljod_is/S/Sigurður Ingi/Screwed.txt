Screwed

these demons inside
they whisper words
doing their deeds
I’ll be free like the birds

chop of that head
poison the bread
fight our fight
and we’ll reward you well
fight through the night
and you can sleep in hell
we’ll make you imortal
we’ll take all the pain
one thing in return
you’ll become insane
com’on boy what’ya say?
you got a lot to gain
don’t look to the skies
God’s got nothing to give
hang out with us
and we might let you live
we’ll take you on a tour
to so many places
give you new clothes, money
even new faces
if you just keep killing those persons
who stand in our way
kill clerks, preists and nuns
their all so gay
all you gotta do is say yes
and we’ll begin today
you just pick up that gun
go out and start to slay
start at the bottom
then work youre way up
think of this like a competition
and youre aiming for the cup
three years later youre in Italy
time to destroy Rome
this blessed city
christians call home
YAY! you did it
you killed the pope
now they will fall
they lost all their hope
you think about God?
why? he is fake
wait a minute
why does the earth shake?
the portraits are falling
what is going on?
who the fuck is that?
oh shit, its Jesus, Gods son
qiuck get Lucifer
he will help us out
hit the floor
and give it a shout
“Yo Satan, wassup?
is Lucy home?”
“NO, SHE’S TORTURING SLAVES
DOWN AT THE DOME”
well to bad for you kid
Jesus is MAD
and you know what that means
yep, that is BAD
guess I’ll go with you
might as well
whats the worst He can do?
send you to hell?
