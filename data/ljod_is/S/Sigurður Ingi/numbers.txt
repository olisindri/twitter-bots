numbers

put the numbers together
but no result
maybe the wrong numbers
not my fault
if the magnitude of the number
can be divide by two
then the answer is solid
but not necessarily true
for the equation can change at any given time
just like algebra, working in this very rhyme
but that you cant understand
because Iâ€™m not ready to describe
the multitude of letters
and the degree of their hidden vibe
they signal each other
and send a secret code
for our brain to figure out
in systematic mode
quietly entering and never going out
digging in our moral decoration
insuring our inescapable
and point blank isolation
because numbers have a gift
a unique ability to distract
make us vulnerable to attack
while we do the calculation
