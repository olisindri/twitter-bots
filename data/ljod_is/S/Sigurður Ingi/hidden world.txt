hidden world

in this forgotten realm
silence is essential
potraing a picture
of all its potential

halls with many moments
that cant be missplaced
listings of true people
that wont be enlaced

gather the fun 
the happy and the best
put them in a pile
get rid of all the rest

thinking of appearence
no mirrors in this dimension
make good of the dreams
donâ€™t wander into expansion

now and then
from time to space
comforting feeling
hiding ones face

no truth nor lie
this world we defend
wondering why
will there ever be an end
