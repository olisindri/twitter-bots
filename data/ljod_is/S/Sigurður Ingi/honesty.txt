honesty

got to be honest
be true and clear
make people find truth
pain without a tear

I have done it before
so why cant you
accept the world
and see it is true

sure I’ve made choises
some stupid, some bad
but that don’t mean regret
needs to be this sad

you feel what is right
at that time and place
you execute your feelings
and give up the chase

it’s not what you want
or what you think you need
it’s a shameless act of the self
trying to feed and bleed

for the pain is a gain
of visdom and wits
building for the future
of so many hits
