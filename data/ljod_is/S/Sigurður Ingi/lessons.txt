lessons

why look for an exit 
when you’ll find a new start

falling out the door,  
I can’t concieve

worlds are made of bits
that finally fall apart

feeling the thresh hold
becoming nearer

they teach us nothing
and let us learn to get smart

looking for my roots
I only decieve

keeping a secret cover
of this ancient and secret art

nobody behind me,
all because I fear her
