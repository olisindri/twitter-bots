rhyme

I can write a rhyme
with so much meaning
read it out loud
without showing a feeling
you bite on youre lips
tighten youre fist
and all you can do
is look at the ceiling

these aren´t my words
their made up charachteristic
feelings of persons
who are supposed to be realistic
she don’t matter
he and hitting
made for fitting
to make everything extra mystic

you want the answer?
you have to read
ask me a question
and I’ll give you a lead
but first you must give
for it is not cheap
to know where to sow
before you can reap
