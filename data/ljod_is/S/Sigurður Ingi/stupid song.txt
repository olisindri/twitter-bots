stupid song

the fueling hate is hiding in conception
driving the mind to suicidal depression
raising in the air
our fists like a dare
to stop all the madness
get rid of all the sadness
we protess this clockwork human behavior
awaiting the arrival of the one and only savior
but nobody comes to rush us away
escaping the insanity of another day
so we hold on to hope, peace and free will
praying that tomorrow there’ll be no one to kill
but if the world was that perfect
and everyone would get along
then we wouldn’t be sitting here
listening to this stupid song
