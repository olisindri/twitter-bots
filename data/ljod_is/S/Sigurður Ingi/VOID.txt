VOID

can you hear the beat
the beat of a heart that is dead
in a space full of emptyness
just like a void

can you feel the defeat
the defeat of me and my head
in a space empty but still full
just like a void

can you look at the resurection
look but not see
in my head no more space for nothing
just like a void

can you conquer the action
laugh but not feel
feeling for someone or something
not like a void

I escape from reality
into my shell
frozen outside
far from a void

I stop all activity
burninig in hell
staying on the inside
my heart is a void
