witch is witch
what is where
this is this
and that is over there
sex is devided
from now untill then
the coin is two sided
with women and men
but what if you flip it
and it lands on its edge
would you be forcing nature
drawing towards the ledge
some undefined secret
a superhuman race
another hero for us all
a hero with no face
will he save us now
will she make us lunch
will it  eat our brains
and save our heart for brunch
should it talk like we walk
should he fly through the skies
should shee cook and not look
no senses, no mind, not even with eyes
you judge it so harsly
just because it’s weak
putting down others
in this comfort you seek
I’m just like you
and you’re just like me
but I search through youre dictionary
and theres no such thing as “we”
this is that
and witch is where
you get the point
it’s written over there
