Assasin

standing firm
with a fist in the air
look down the hill
with the wind in my hair

piercing my eyes
looking for a soul
to destroy something
that is my only goal

seeking for some movement
a target for the kill
showing some improvement
an upgrade for my skill

crackle, snap, I hear a sound
a split second to decide
should I pick up a gun
or use the sword to chop it wide

rushing towards the victim
but loose the concentration
as I move in closer
I can make out a conversation

I make out two men
their shouting at each other
looks as though they
were each his own  brother

I don’t need this right now
I didn’t rush down the hill
to see these idiots argue about each other
I came here to kill

my senses are clean
and I’m ready to test
the skill I hone
I won’t even rest

I wind up my sword
and pick up my gun
take my chances
this will be fun

comprehending the end of life
one pull, one swing
chop and bang, there it goes
two lifes, easy thing

move in for the kill
to late to turn away
the horror has begun
and it makes me want to stay

I jump out in the clearing
element of surprise
kill them without knowing
that is my demise

now I aim at ones forehead
and clock’em with my gun
now I must make haste  
cause the other is on the run

a sidestep to the left
and I dash for the other
catch up with him easy
sometimes I hardly bother

stab him with my blade
this I will enjoy
like a baby boy at christmas
I play with him like a toy

cut off an arm
and stab him once more
this is getting messy
but I still love the gore

I put him out of his missery
and make his head into a ball
but as I’m cleaning my blade
I come to a sudden stall

I look back to where I came
and theres no body on the ground
this isn’t good, failure is not an option
and that means he has to be found

I start to search the bushes
but find nothing at all
then rolls by a head
that I just turned into a ball

he stands there pretty pist
and he’s got that look in his eyes
the burning rage of a brother
who will never know the lies

he snaps and he runs
I go for my gun
I smoke up his lungs
and now he is done

I did my job
I killed for pleasure
I fucked them up
without taking a measure

as I’m leaving the clearing
I look back once more
but now their both gone
not blood, not even gore

this is rediculous
I made shure they were dead
but then I start to wonder
was it all in my head?
