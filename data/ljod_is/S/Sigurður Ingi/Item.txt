Item

man life is hard, cruel and no justice
yeah, here I go again, even if I’m rusted
but only so you know that I can see myself
putting this grudge on top of the highest shelf
contacting the mind, the heart and the soul
finding if that last litile drop filled up the bowl
of patience and stamina, I can barely move on
even I wouldn’t notice if this was all gone
motivated by spite and hatefull intensions
driving my voice into madness and dimension
tic tac, tic tac, time is getting low
time to pay up what I already owe
I ain’t broke but still not very wealthy
smoking cigarettes and still pretty healthy
so if I’m an item, then why won’t they pick me?
