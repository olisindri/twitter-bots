Ghost ride

crucify your beliefs
and leave them alone
but when you die
where will you roam?
like electric pulses
hidden in the air
phantomising visions 
giving you the glare
hidden in your shelter
look out through a hole
making invisibility
a shield for your soul
wishing ghosts wouldn’t see you
but they can see all
the rules don’t apply to them
they have taken the fall
would you duel eternity
and stay on this plane?
for one shot at real-presence?
to have something to gain?
like the wiseman said
you get what you deserve
those who bend, will break
those who sway, will curve
those who jump
and land on their feet
shouldn’t have to crawl
to get back to their seat
so embrace yourself
we are in for a ride
life is full of changes
like the wind and the tide
