death row

damn this shit ,I’m taking it all back
of course I am, you knew this was all whack
take my spare shit and put in the recycling rack
until I straighten out and get ready to get back on track
fiddle with these words until they grow old and grey
then suddenly I realise I ain’t got shit to say
and when you wake up from the sleep and see its day
you maybe stop daydreaming and start thinking like okay
I suck, I’m a shamed but that shit don’t matter
stop fucking with this shit, thinking wich beat is fatter
listening to my music, before my brain begins to splatter
I’m doing this my way and not yours nor the latter
bringing down the same rhymes as I did the last time
from me to you and all the same shit that didn’t rhyme
cursing like I was raised in the one O nine
don’t sweat it homie, I’m not trippin’, no I’m fine
playing the game like I was raised to make rules
to fake the true meaning for all of those ignorant fools
making insecure fuckers wannabee’s drools
riding on their back like they were some fucking mules
now I’m taking the shield off, you wish I wouldnt’ do so
couse now I’m coming after your ass like you was a real ho
and don’t try and play all stupid like you could blackmail me with that do’
I might just commit suicide and make it look like you did it to put you on death row
