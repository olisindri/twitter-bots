Golden Calf

make peace with god
and shove him in his grave
trust in the only thing you can see
thats youreself, and all you can save
spite towards the heavens but not the stars
trying to hide the pain, lying beneath the scars
praise the one who cant reach it all
it’s not his fault that he’s not tall
feel in the air, a bitter hint of realtiy
raindrops on the street
give your mind to the society
and fall at their feet
hit the dead, and burn the living
just don’t expect me to be as forgiving
as the god that you worshiped all this time
he’s got no power here, this world is mine
in my domain, there are only a few rules
and their made by me
I manipulate them at my own will
that you can clearly see
if you had the power of a god
would you not do exactly the same
of course you would
you’d do anything to be apart of the game
but you ain’t no master
I’m the one in command
with a flick of a finger
I send you to the no-mans-land
so shut it and stop messing around
I’m tired of your whining
get all of your shit together
and try to start shining
so they won’t realise
that I am the only boss
not the poor old fool
that they hung up on that cross
