My Mind

Darkened my mind, I can’t see clearly. These kittens lick my wounds you inflicted, on my heart that was in the way of you’re rout. Making my stink too the roots of all eternity, nobody cares...... Don’t read these lines, feel them, like they where the cold shiver of an old womans hand stroking you’re back, trying to comfort, but only making it harder not to realise what this world intends for us. Because she doesn’t know how, when or why we think like we think. We are the future but we are also responsible for making the past not fade away. Accomplish this and we can rest in peace with knowing that our effort doesn’t go to waste. But in the end all is wasted.................... The future, the present and even the past.......... All is wasted...
