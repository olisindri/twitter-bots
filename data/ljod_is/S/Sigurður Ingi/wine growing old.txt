wine growing old

this condamned generation
the youth of our nation
doing things they havent been taught
without thinking what if they get caught
but not in a fashioned way
just the silent style, like nothing to say
soloing amongst us all their spirit dissapear
hiding in that cool and strong state of mind
what they dare not talk about, what they fear
worrying that they’ll fall out, getting left behind
nobody cares, just do your own thing
have a drink, bring on the new fling
light up a joint, and make love to the smoke
dont flame it to much, or you just might choke
greed is a sin, just like lust
wipe away the tears and watch them become dust
nowere to play, nothing to choose
one option available, it’s to refuse
but they stay strong, so hard and cool
drinking some more, like cars need fuel
they sink even deeper then the bum down the street
waking up one morning, without anyone to greet
alone and ashamed for their past redemption
nothing else matters but the next pention
more money more booze
they still cant refuse
they do this shit stupid and ignorant of all 
like the man with a paycheck goes to the mall
buying the same today
just like yesterday
something unwanted, that won’t ever last
only works for a moment, then becomes the past
