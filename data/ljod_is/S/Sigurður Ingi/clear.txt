clear

setting the goal bar way to tall
trying to reach it to pull it down
showing it to each one and all
attempting to turn this all around

breaking some rules
I set for myself
and falling like fools
I change myself

turning theory to history
and retracing my track
hiding the truth from only me
so it won’t hit me in the back

the stars are making music and singing
in a cosmetic and unstable ray
telling me what I’m really thinking
but I don’t understand what they say

the way this shows me 
how not to be
I recognize clearly
but hardly see
