flies

all shallow and low
you think I am slow
but while you think about that
I’m gone with the flow

leaving you, I can’t imagine
making up words, disilusion
to see, taste and touch
that is the best fusion

fractions, divided and shattered
cant take this any more
questions, reminded and thinking
what are these things for

shake my hand, and call me an intro
to the life that is so eagerly waiting
to push you through, to finish the outro
listen to me and you won’t go wailing

facts of life cant be explaned, only formed
all living things must be awere
these facts will beat you up, lika a storm
realize why, and then what and where

proceed to the answers, and open them up
read them out loud, so all can hear
a significant other is a crutch to hold them up
and also a burden, that so many cant bear

like flies eat leftovers, for that they are fit
following their purpose, thats what they are for
not like some of us, who eat up the shit
misleading guideline, they fall for the lore

the longer you think,
the more you think you understand
you dont need to think
just look at you’re toes, and see the land

we are on earth, this godforsaken place
all of the idols, fighting inside with a mace
to discover their purpose, like the flies
no matter how much they look, they won’t find a trace

see the mirror, that is just a reflection
only reason you dont like it
is because you’ve seen it so often, no affection
imagine no mirrors, you wouldnt make it

to hung up on youreself to give a damn about me
I don’t care, all I want you to see
is that I know this shit, and so should you
I say my farewell, I’ll let you be
