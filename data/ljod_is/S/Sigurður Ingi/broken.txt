broken

flying on wings
wings of love
morning view
light from above

sky so blue
clouds so white
falling for you
disrupting the flight

looking down
crash and burn
heading for disaster
nowhere to turn

light from above
has nothing to say
stading a cause
it brings a new day

enjoy the fall
wind in your face
close your eyes
give up the chase
