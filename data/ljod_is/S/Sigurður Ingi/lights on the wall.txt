lights on the wall

light hits the wall 
and casts an image
of an ugly thing 
called our linage
the people of the past
where there doing wrong
we try to fix the problems
its been way to long

just because we sin in a new way
is today better then before
we still do the same things 
but keep fucking up more
again and again
we trip and we fall
until we hit the switch
and see the image on the wall

suddenly the future is clear
and we loose all the fear
the map of things to come
is hidden in the rear
our list of demands
suddenly goes away
we fall asleep
and wake up the next day

we go through this routeen
just as amazed
we cant figure it out
confused and dased
cant fix these problems
and away we shy
the past will haunt us
till the day we die
