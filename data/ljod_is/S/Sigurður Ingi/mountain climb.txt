mountain climb

somehow he’s got this strange notion
that he feels the same old emotion
he hiked the wrong side and now he will fall
hurting so much that he’s forced to crawl
he looks up to the top, it’s way to steep
if he fails again, he’ll surely go deep
but turning around is not a dignified way
not reaching the top at the end of the day
he must make an attempt at not giving up
he raises his spirit and drinks from the cup
takes the first step and gets ready to start
pulse and heartbeat are way of the chart
he’s nervous, what if he makes a mistake
if he falls again the consequence he’ll take
it’ll rid him of all his honour and his pride
suddenly someone is standing by his side
it’s a friend with a grin and a smile on it’s face
telling him to chill out and put down the pace
so he takes it’s advice and eases off gently
scans the horizon for something he can’t see
the red beams of sunlight begin to emerge
defying the fatigue and the restless urge
he has to sleep and rebuild his strength
otherwise he won’t make the whole length
disapointed and discouraged
he lays down and looks at a star
feeling rage and envy
why he could only get this far
he aimed at the peak
now lost and a freak
the way down will be hurt, pain and sorrow
beacuse his friends advice he decided to follow
he blames it on him, her and them
the next try will be harder, times ten
will this repeat itself again
and the moral be the same as then
that he was forced to stop
before he got to the top
