struggle

man this is hard
I don’t know what to do
trying to waste away the day
just to get through
to the next
and there after
remembering nothing
only your beautifull laughter
the sound of your voice
and those incredible eyes
like singin birds
in the early sunrise
why me
why so long
I can´t turn my head
yet I feel this is wrong
these emotions are solid
so hard to embrace
for if I act upon them
I’ll get slapped in the face
risk isn’t an option
the plan would fail
putting in my heart
another dirty nail
and so the struggle continues
for mere self-control
can’t loose my temper
must hold on to the soul
try to further myself
to keep a safe distance
but end up like always
reaching out for assistance
