I for an I

I’m bored as hell
I got nothing to do
I wish you where here
because I really miss you
I spend my time thinking
what if you came back
then I see why you’re not here
what I have and what I lack
there\'s no fucking sound
only silence and shame
I’m too afraid to speak up
and for that I am lame
I look out to the sky
and know you see the same
what if I stare long enough,
will I finally forget your name?
now when you’re gone
I sit here alone
I ain’t got no purpose
much like a stone
just laying on the ground
waiting for the next kick
a kick towards the end
so hopefull and yet so sick
everyone else gets a chance
and make use of what they get
but I never get a chance
because everyone else thinks I’m not set
well fuck ya’ll and screw you
I’m gonna do what I do
fuck up you’re whole life
and gut it all the way through
isn’t that what you want?
for me to make it bad?
better then you standing there
thinking that I’m sad
look at me with pity
I think you’re mistaken
I havent lost anything
but from you I have taken
money, time & emotions
all the normality
replaced with sickness
that’s just a formality
you wont let me in
so now I must pickup the lock
the one protection to your soul
you stupid litlie fuck
I’m gonna get in
one way or another
I got the persistance
more then any other
I’m also at the end
an inch from the edge
losing every bit of sanity
to you this I pledge
I don’t know what to do
I don’t really give a shit
I know what to do
I’ll throw a fucking fit
smash all the windows
break down the walls
rip apart every door
and spread shit all over the floor
fight in-animate objects
so I won’t hurt anyones feelings
intences the pain
so I can cover up the meanings
transform to a teddy
cuddly and cute
damned to be so weak
myself I could shoot
fuck all this depression
I’m pist as hell
gonna rip you to pieces
and bid you farewell
fuck this holy pipe
and your stupid mariuana
you can fry your own brain
I’m gone, cionara
