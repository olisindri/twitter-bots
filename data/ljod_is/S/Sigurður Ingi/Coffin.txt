Coffin

rain from the skies
rain in my eyes
covering the sweat and tears
that I cant disguise

looking at the skies
looking with my eyes
revealing all the answers
the one thing that defines

pulling the plug is not the way
it is just an ugly way to say
that you and me will never be
I just cant bare to stay

wake up in the morning
go to sleep at night
this restlessness in all of us
but yet we still do fight

burning in our organs
emotions run in fear
you die along with all of them
but I cant shed a tear

you and me forever
and all of us together
rain or snow, youâ€™ll never know
it all depends on the weather
