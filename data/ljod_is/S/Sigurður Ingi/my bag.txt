my bag

the weight on my shoulders
is continuously mistaken
still dragging my feet
until the slumber is awaken

when the bells will ring
the weight is finally lifted
and so shall the spirit
be rightfully gifted

an award for the service
a price for the winner
for lifting up the guilt
and forgiving the sinner

find what has been mine
to make your’s rise above
the step goes to push
and push goes to shove

this has always been mine
and you won’t take it away
no matter how hard you try
you’ll hear what I have to say

I worked very very hard
and much much to long
to give up the rights
and give up the wrongs

this is my trophy
my one and only price
my shoulders alone can take it
because of it’s abnormal size
