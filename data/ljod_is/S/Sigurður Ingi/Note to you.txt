Note to you

believing that this life isn’t deceive
but deceiving myself that I got a believe
so I go away and make no mistakes
and find that I’m not mature but naive
seeing the hallucination of an illusion
coming down to the conclusion
that right and wrong don’t necessarily mix
but they make a good fusion
proving that a bum
can pick up a gun
showing us that he’s not all that dumb
so he pulls the trigger, It needs to be done
