empty house***

building it all up like never before
climax appearing in the form of solution
brick after brick, trying to stay focused
the point of it all lost in the confusion

waiting for something to come by
people opening their minds for insertion
looking for a way out but no exit
here and here, disapproval and direction

walls are rising, doors not made
finding the answer to the question
timeless hourglass, broken but not empty
awating the arrival at the station

nobody is there, still all alone
not even lights to make a shadow mate
just blinding darkness, burning black
not enough room to make fake hate

no clothes, no water
no external pain
not even a roof above the head
to protect it from the rain

scream to hear an echo
scream for a sound
waves hit the walls
and reject all around

only a few have seen this house
one, maybe two
they all gasp at the sight of it
and so might you
