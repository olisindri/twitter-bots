She girl

Lovely and cute
she whips up her hair
acting all cool, making it harder
for me not to care.
She looks in my eyes
and melts me from within,
seeing all but none at a time,
trying to walk, but she won’t let me stand.
My brain in pieces, 
trying to collect,
puzzle without preview
not easy to forget.
In English we speak
but I can’t seem to talk
all the voices in my head 
blocking it out.
Freeing my innerself 
from a prison,
that I built for myself. 
This insanity... 
Struggling...
Want to loosen the chains 
but I’m blinded from her light,
shining so hard in the lonely night.
Trying to shut it off,
but I can’t find the switch, 
because she was meant too live.
This beautiful thing that I can’t resist,
she won’t come to me and I can’t get to close.
She can’t hear me cause I’m making it too loud for her to make it out,
in the flood of messages, that everyone but me tries to get along.
But I’m just a sender not a receiver, so why even try?
no one receives what I’m trying to send...
All alone in the silence 
I still hear her voice
but it’s not meant for me.
For I’m not worthy, 
even with the knife in my hand.
She still doesn’t understand
But is that the purpose?
for her too understand?
I’ll never know...
but I can speculate, while waiting for life too pass me by
only for me too look back and listen 
to sentences, of someone who doesn’t know me.
Like she doesn’t know me, none the less reckognizes me in the crowd
while none of them see that I was made for her, but she not for me.
Hard to accept, but truthfully painfull
Like the bad guy in the movies, unless the hero dies,
and the bad guy lives on, only to be hated by more and more people.
But one day...
One day,
he’ll descover, someone that loves him because he is hated by all.
Like she will see
that I’m not for her, but it was there for every one too see in the first place.
asking the same question won’t get me anywhere far,
unless, she could give me a answer,
But she can’t.
I must descover the real question
Was she ever made for me?
Or am I just a sick litlie puppy, trying to bark at a too big of a bone?
Maybe the question is that I won’t get no sleep till I get an 
answer that will satisfy me but not her?
Never...
That I could not bear on these old and battered shoulders.
But can I even bare myself from dying within
or trying to make this work?
Make what work?
That might just be the question!
