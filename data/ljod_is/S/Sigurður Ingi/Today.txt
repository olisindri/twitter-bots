Today

Today I saw
that I had been focusing
on the wrong things in life
Yesterday I saw
nothing

Tomorrow I will see
that I was right all along
but still, I was wrong
Because, whats right is right
and whats wrong is right in the eye’s
of whom who thinks he is right.

At the end
I’ll end up alone
out on the street
because...
I thought I was right
