stuck on the road to oblivion

I’ve forgotten the art
I don’t know where to start
so I’m gonna try my best
and start with my heart
It’s hidden behind a wall
a wall that doesn’t fall
if you want to see the other side
you have to make the right call
the decision is what we make it be
you can’t turn back time
now shame on you to feel so free
and get behind the line
you hurt me still
but I’m to blame
for being so stupid
in my brain
to think that the scars would go away
the day that you came along
you would fix it all with what you say
how could I have been so wrong
this curse is a blessing in a disguise
within it a whole bunch of truth and lies
but all of that seems to disappear
when I look into your beautiful eyes
I cant make words to describe
the way you make me feel
so I negotiated with myself today
and made a darn good deal
I’m going to make a new road in life
a road that was ment for only me
without the things and stuff I want
and it will be all that I see
because I am alone
all I got are dreams
it’s worthless to you
hard as it seems
I can never give you
what you’ve given to me
a concept of thought
so simple to see
that the road that I’ll walk
will finally descend
alone in oblivion
that’s were I will end
