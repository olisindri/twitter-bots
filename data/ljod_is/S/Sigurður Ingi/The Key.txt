The Key

desperation, on the edge of consealment
hoping the best, I need to rest
finding an angel, I fracture my heart
no more rest, I still hope the best
typing as an old man, 
but still just a boy
I don’t really mind
just trying to enjoy
folding this paper
the key to my heart
you think that I’m mushy
thats where it all starts
playing the music
pretending that you hear
but you can’t hear shit
because of youre biggest fear
that would be to open up
youre emotions to people
thank god for this gift
at least you are able
closed forever, try to break free
I lost the key
thinking “mistake”
there never was a key
