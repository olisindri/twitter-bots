shiny

far away in the lonely night
sits a lonely girl with a shiny knife
she’s hoping for someone that comes along
and shows her the world and where to belong
will you be her sheppard and most trusted friend?
guide her through life untill the very end?
laugh at her jokes and stroke her hair?
open her mind to the sweet open air?
will you be the one who follows and obeys?
or the one who disgusts all and betreys?
the one who lifts her heart up high?
or burries her corpse with a sigh?
these are all questions
that truth won’t consume
she still sits alone
in her lonely room
so far away
ends another life
as she reflects these questions
in that one shiny knife...
