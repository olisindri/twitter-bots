deadline

I promised myself
I wouldn\'t - couldn\'t
Do it again
This time will be different
Time spent
Wisely. Precisely.
I\'ve burnt my midnight oil
Down to the last drop
Top up!
The time draws near. Fear.
This time I won\'t pull it off.
Enough is enough,
Next time will be different
Barely made it,
Forgot the footnotes, the quotes
I should\'ave - Could\'ave
but didn\'t - couldn\'t .

Got away with it, again,
Next time will be different
