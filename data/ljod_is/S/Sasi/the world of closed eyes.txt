the world of closed eyes

If you close your eyes, what can you see?
Nothing?
I disagree

Give it some thought, set your mind free
Tell me again, what can you see?
Nothing?
I disagree
The inside of eyelids is what you can see.

A canvas wiped blank, each time you blink
Reach for the paintbrush and sink -
it in colours and paint what you think
The painting remains till the next time you blink

Letâ€™s try it once  more, this time with feeling,
The inside of eyelids are only a ceiling
Like a sky to the ground, so much in between
From eye to eyelid, so much to be seen

The best thing about this world of closed eyes?
You can be who you are or wear a disguise
Tell only the truth or tell only lies
Mix it all up be naughty or nice, shrink as you will
or double in size
Take part in a race and take home the prize
Travel to china for a thimble of rice
Why not walk back for the exercise?

Do as you wish, but this one thing applies
There are no rules in the world of closed eyes.
