there was joy 
there was fun 
i had the beast 
on the run 

i trembled with fear
subsiding my pain 
would it be here
there was nothing to gain

the earth stood still
hoping and waiting
no one to kill
no one i was hating 

i was fulfilled 
my beast was asleep
it had no one to kill
no where to creep

i understood beauty
but was pretty shaken 
dying of fear 
that my beast would awaken
