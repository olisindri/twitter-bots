Don\'t go!

I saw you
walking down the street
I fell in love of your smile,
your eyes and your stile,
then I fell in love with you.
Now we are togeather
and we love each other
we have been togeather just..forever!
and I love you so
will never let you go
so don\'t leave
can\'t think about your moving
away from me!
why do you have to?
I\'m gona miss you so,
more then you will ever know!
so just.. Don\'t go!
I love you.
