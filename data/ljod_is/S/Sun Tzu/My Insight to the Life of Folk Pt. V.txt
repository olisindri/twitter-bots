My Insight to the Life of Folk Pt. V

I’m standing here, out in the street

I’m longing for knowing, someone I meet

I want to go home, I need to get back

The memory of home is something I lack

  
When I look in the mirror, all I see is a stranger

And the mother Mary, with Jesus in a manger

Why did I leave, and where did I come from

Do I have someone to love, is my family long gone

  
Find me

Know me

I need to know who I am

Find me

Tell me

Who in the hell I am

  
All I remember, is when I was young

The games that we played, and the songs we sung

I remember my house, so big and so new

My fathers’ big briefcase, my mothers taboo

  
I can’t really think, my mind is just spinning

Why write a book with just the beginning

I should know this street I’ve been here before

Been walking for hours my feet are so sore

  
Find me

Know me

I need to know who I am

Find me

Tell me

Who in the hell I am

  
There is a white car, with big flashing lights

You can see them so bright in the winter dark nights

It is stopping right by me, some men jump out

They grab me to tightly, so I start to shout!!!

  
Tell me

You know me

I need to know who I am

Tell me

Answer me

Who in the hell I am

  
I need to know who I am
