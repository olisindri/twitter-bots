The Aliens Love Of Me

Hello, are you an alien
I am just a man
A true Episcopalian
Do you have a plan



Do you want to wipe us out
With that big Omega-ray
Or should I go, scream and shout
You’re santa with your sleigh


 Please, tell me now
Are you a friend or a foe
Am I going to allow
For them to list you as John Doe


Answer me quick, Answer me well
Or I shall have to kill you
And when they ring that awful bell
No one will bid adieu

 What are you saying 
Is it Morse that you speak
Is it music your playing
What is it that you seek

Why are you leaving
Do you dislike me
Or was it just recieving
My love, that had had you flee
 

I hope you come back someday
To tell me how you can say
What had you to go away
Was it they 
Or was it all a big display
My god, this is such a cliché
