The King of Nowhere

Are you gonna rock me
Like the mad man you are
You ain't gonna stop me
Cuz' I've just gone to far

A simple mind a simple pleasure
God where is my treasure
I'll probably never find it
But I want it 
I want it so bad

They all sing their blues
That's their song
They would all trade their shoes
Just for a bong

A simple mind a simple pleasure
God where is my treasure
I'll probably never find it
But I want it 
I want it so bad

What the fuck is techno about
Nobody likes it
Except for some little scout
But his costume doesn't even fit

I am king in land of wonder
I am king in the land down under
I am king everywhere
