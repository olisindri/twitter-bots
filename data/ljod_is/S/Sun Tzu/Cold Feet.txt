Cold Feet

I like the long summer walks
 We take on together
 One of us talks and talks
 About life, death and the weather 
 Simply strolling down the beach 
 Me and you having fun 
 Oh, all the simple things you teach
 Like how you’ve always hated your mum 

 

 

 The sun shines so bright
  I can barely see you out there
 The sea has always given me such a fright
 The big, big ocean, it gives me such a scare
 You call me, I can’t hear a word
 What the hell are you saying 
 Drowning? Thats absurd 
 You always go out there playing 

 

 

 I can’t come out and save you 
 I’m afraid of the water 
 Why is it so big and blue 
 Why wasn’t I born an otter 
 Oh fuck it I’m coming 
 Please just stay alive 
 Remember the song you were humming? 
 I think it was I will survive   

 

 

 What can I do 
 Without out you 
 The man I knew
  I’d be so blue
 All alone in this big scary fog 
 You’ll go to heaven 
 I’ll stay here, a sad hairy dog   

 

 

There’s your body 
Next to me  
There’s your body 
It’ has to be 
There’s your body
That bloody sea 
There’s your body 
Your name was Andy
