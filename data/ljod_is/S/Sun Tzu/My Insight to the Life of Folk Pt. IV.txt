My Insight to the Life of Folk Pt. IV

I sat around with a pick in my left and a guitar in my right
My head was screaming, the tune was flowing I had to get it out
But my playing was bad and I became mad, my hand was becoming white
All I wanted to do was to scream out loud and I was in no doubt

The days went by and all I did was  playing, this beautiful Rock’n Roll
The sound was right, the tones were perfect so I tried to sing a long
It was harder than playing, so I began praying to find me a David Ghrol 
That could sing my song like it ought to be, I thought boy, what can go wrong



I don’t do the blues, it's yesterday's news
I’m a rocker
I can’t play pop, I wanna go to the top
I’m a rocker
I don’t have to funk, I’ve got a pretty nice junk
I’m a rocker
A rocker to the bone



I began searching for guys who had skills, I had to form a band
I looked everywhere, even back out there, no one was good enough,
So I went to a bar, not very far from the angels holy land
I got to play with good guys and they really looked oh so tough

Now they were pretty damned good I had to get them to play my little  lonely tune
They liked my style and they liked my song so they all simply agreed,
To be in my band, travel the land and release a record late in June
We got a deal with a guy that was really high he said “Guys you will succeed”



I’ll never rap it’s just so much crap
I’m a rocker
I couldn’t  play soul I’d go out of control
I’m a rocker
I simply won't swing unless I become king
I’m a rocker
A rocker to the bone 



Now everythings perfect and I’m singing live, at Royal Albert Hall
The sound is perfect and I’m playing my song like I’d always hoped for
The guys are great the audiance wait, while we build a musical wall
 I’m going to play the the best fucking solo that was made since the war


I don’t do the blues
I can’t play pop
I don’t have to funk
I’ll never rap
I couldn’t play soul
I simply won't swing
I’m a rocker
A great, mean crazy rocker
A rocker until I die
