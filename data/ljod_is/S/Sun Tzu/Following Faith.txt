Following Faith

Join me in a quest for perfection.
Ending never in our search.
Seeking for something that isnâ€™t there
Useless for we are never to be heard of
Souls without heart, souls without a body



 

 

 

 

Fearfull of the guilt we can not bare
Use your strength to defeat your foes
C everything, hear everything
Kings can not win us we are gods
I am the ruler of gods
No one can take my thrown of solitude
God of men, God of souls and God of you



 

 

Come and play with your powers
Hero in the eyes of a stranger
Reptile in the eyes of a fool
Infamous in the eyes of a peasant
Saying what you want to say
Touching what you want to touch

 

 

 

 

Win the heart of the one you love
Hammer upon your enemies
Always be free, never to be chained
Timeless is your life never to end

 

 

 

 

I
S

 

 

 

 

This really what you want 
Hell only to wait for you
In the flames and heat, stabbed by deamons
Satan sipping upon your leaking blood

 

 

 

 

Bloodless 
Useless
Lifeless
Loveless
Sinfull
Hatefull
Idiot you were following me to your horrible death
Time has finally caught up with you and taken all your wealth
