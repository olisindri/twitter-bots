Waking death

In waking death I find solace
In waking death I find peace
In waking death I find myself
In waking death I find life

She touched me and I flinched.
I fell down and cried, laughed, went mad, got mad, felt alone, felt safe.

As she woke I died and got born at the same time, endlessly.

To live, I woke death.
