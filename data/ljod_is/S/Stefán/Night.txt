Night

If dawn is birth, dusk is death and the day is life,
what then is the night?
C.a. nine months in the woumb
or forever locked inside an earthly tomb?
What happens after dusk? Are we reborn, is there another dawn?
Are we transported to other places where there is no dusk or dawn,
one of eternal day or one of eternal night?
Do we get another chance at the day
and another day after that, infinantly? 

Whatever the night may bring, I\'ll dream tonight.
