Angel

Angel, come fly away with me
Into your life and all dreams there within
waiting to take you away
Soft hopes with the spark of new begun life
will guide you along your way

Angel, come walk along with me
Along the path you choose for yourself
each and every day
don\'t let them decide and never you hide
the choice is yours alone

Angel, don\'t wait to long for me
your destiny lies before you inside
the mind and the soul
why walk in the shade though the sun\'s shining late
there\'s always a lighted path
Like the bright colored morning and evening star
you shine as a million warm suns
