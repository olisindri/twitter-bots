Depression

Oh, sister Death, when will you come for me?
Why do you take those who don\'t want to go,
when \'tis I who needs it the most?
Free my soul from the nightmare that I, myself created.
Free me from the burden of the Endless, for I see the light nomore.
Even here, in the kingdom of my own making,
I cannot conjure a dream to realease me from this darkness.

And so I cry out to you my sister, Death.
