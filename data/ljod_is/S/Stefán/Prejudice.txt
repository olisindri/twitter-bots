Prejudice

We prejudge our lives
Here we are and there we\'ll go
False notions of paths on which we\'ll flow
we\'re occupied with lies

Deciding forevermore
How can we be so naive to think
we\'ll pull the plug that drains the sink
we\'ll shoot but never score

Foolish need for control
From mountain tops to desert beach
The knowledge must be in our reach
Condemning of the soul

We don\'t belive in time
We think there\'s not enough to spend
Curious we strech around the bend
Becomes a wasted rhyme

It\'s no way to live
This is what we all must do
Ignorance is piss in your shoe
we take and never give

How can we surely tell?
When he\'s planned a rise or fall
If there is a he at all
The soul I\'ll never sell

Darkness lies ahead
No lights shine on the road beyond
Of death we have become to fond
It\'s all inside our head
