This black day

Beneath me I see my shadow
Walking, talking, acting
Pretending to be alive as if he were me
A continuous game of charades where no one wins
And quitting doesnâ€™t exist
Only in death can I put an end to the divine mockery
Only in death can I truly be free to see the truth
This black day I feel the pain of the ages
Turmoil inside my aching bones struggling to be released
Yet again, like a plague upon my world
It smites everything in its path with its potency
This black day, I died
