Fantasy

Travelling sideways, following the moon
Skipping over rainbows on a damp afternoon
Crawling through the sky, with the head in the trees
Poking at the stars with the cool night breeze
Swimming through tall green grass, swaying playfully
Gather together and join the dream of tomorrows fantasy
