Inside

Is this pain i feel
Or is this memory
Can i ever be
Set free again

Prisoned down
In agony
I need your help
Would you set me free

I wanna close my self
Inside the world

Can it all be true
Can it feel so wrong
Can the hate for them 
Really be so strong?

As i share the pain 
With you again
I see my life 
Going down the drain

I wanna close myself
Inside the world
