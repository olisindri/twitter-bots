Why

been alone, all alone for a quite good time
shouldnt have to do it all again just see how she shines
never mind my thoughts they are false and decieving me
lead me right thru time

who is there, i don't care for you  anymore
leave me all alone you don't know what i'm going thru
you should try to give your heart have it torn
it's so pure and devine

tell me are you free, i shiver
and forever i will let it all pass by

tell me please, how do you get to enjoy life
while i cry myself in to sleep every day and night
i am feeling down and i'm here staring all alone
into sea of time

if i sleep, i will not wake to life again
i don't care so much for the things that i'll leave behind
when i go, please don't cry and please keep in mind
now i'm feeling fine

tell me are you free, i shiver
and forever i will let it all pass by
