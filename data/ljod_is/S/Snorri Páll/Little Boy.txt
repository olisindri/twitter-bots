Little Boy

Little boy tumbles down
Colourful boxes all around
As the world of joy closes
The future of the boy is gone

He needs love from around
But there’s no one there to hold
The mother is fragile and worn
The boy is gonna end up torn

Fields of green gone black
White dust and liquids are at home
Mixed with a life of a twisted soul
Makes a freak that no none knows

Sad to say but that’s how life goes
Wishing that it wouldn’t be true
How this will end, i do not know
You never know what the future holds
