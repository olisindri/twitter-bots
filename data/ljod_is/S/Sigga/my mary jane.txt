my mary jane

i got my brain covered with that funky fluid.
it makes my brain go uncontrollable.
it slowes me down like a dead man's brain.
my minds eye is capeble of seeing what it wants,
when you are with me mary jane.

they say that you will make me go crazy
i got my mind so fucked up i don't care.
all i care about is my mary.
she gives me all the love i need,
she never let's me down.
mary make's my head spin.

somehow, someway she makes me feel on top of thw world.
she never judges me for what i have done
she never judges me for the things iv'e said.
she know how to make me love her.
i love you mary jane.
