Hurt

Tuch my hand and let me feel,
the pain you suffer of.
I can see you are hurt,
because the pain belongs to me.

You are hurt because of me,
it is all my fucking fault.
I am always asking my self,
why i did this to you.

You know that i take,
the sponsebility of all this.
I am angry with my self,
because it's wrong
what i did.

I know that you are angry,
angry with me.
And i'm not gonna blame 
you for this, 
and you have right to be angry with me.

But life goes on,
and we can just forget this.
Even thoe it will be,
alife in our thoughts.
