I miss you

With รก broken heart
i walk trough the street,
the poring rain
hits my feet.

I try so hard
not to cry,
i never even got
a simple goodbye.

I miss you so much
you were my love,
with broken eyes
i see you at above.

I can not go on
i need to fly,
just to see you again
i will have to get so high.

With รก smile on my lips
clime the bridge so tall,
and with pain and love
far dowm i fall.
