My face is a mask

My face is a mask
And behind it I hide
My thoughts, my feelings
My heart and my pride.


My thoughts are dark
And my feelings week
My heart so broken
And for pride I canÂ´t seek 

Constantly happy
Sweet and glad
The surfice is good
But I am always as sad 

My soul is rotten
My heart torn apart
Only way out for my sorrow
Is through my art. 

I love you *****
But hate you aswell
It pains me to say it
But you belong in a cell.
