..

To bear the knife of another soul
not many are worth,
but whom who can as an honest man
shall take it to the earth.

To know the thoughts of a strangers mind
may cause some ones to fall,
But whom who keeps them locked and safe
is anything but, at all.

To hear the whisper of a scared child
but theres nothing left to do,
to feel its pain, cold and wild
coming to it, while going through you.
