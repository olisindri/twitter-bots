Our King

Born in to this world
as the peopleÂ´s king
to walk the earth
and faith to us bring

Along brought twelve
in his fathers name
but soon over spread
his religion and fame

Loved by some
to others a threat
so at last the day came
that he Augustus met

They tied his arms
and they hit his head
after beating and burning
to the hill him lead

Forever be the king
shouts the crowd so high
but on a wooden cross
our king has died.
