Depressed

Here I sit alone in my room
pulling my hair and crying,
hoping for the pain to be over soon
hoping that i will stop dieing.

First i thoght all i needed was rest
to free my mind,
now i think i am deprest
black inside and blind.

Iis eating up my soul
i feek like iÂ´m made of steel,
nothing left inside but a black hole
nothing left to feel.
