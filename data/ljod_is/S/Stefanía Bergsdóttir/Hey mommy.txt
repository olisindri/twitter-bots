Hey mommy

Hey mommy, dear mommy
i dreamt you last night
right after you kissed me
and hugged me so thight

I dreamt you went out
to go and have fun
I dreamt you met a man, mom
who gave you a gun

You where holding the gun
and it made me so sad
and the look on your face, mom
it was pretty mad

And on your way home
a man walked by
I´ve never seen him before
he looked nice, kinda shy

And what happend next
filled me with fear
you hit him in the head mom
and shot him near

He cried in his blood
it made me cry to
he was dieing in the street, mom
and the reson was you

And when I woke up
my eyes were at flood
and now I look at you mommy
you´re covered in blood.
