He´ll use you

I know he´s charming
I know he´s dear,
when he holds you tight
he chases off all you fear.

I know he´s good looking
I know he´s sweet,
with his silly smile
sweaps you off your feet.

I know you feel safe
you think he´s the one,
I´d hate for you to wake up
and see it´s all gone.

So do what is right
and follow your emotions,
but don´t you forget
your very own devotions.

Honey be with that guy
and hope it doesent go wrong,
for he´s georgeus, great
and so very strong.

But sweetheart dont let him
tare you apart,
cause he´ll use you, abuse you
and brake your heart.
