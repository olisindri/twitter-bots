dear mother

You heard my cry
and you saw my fears,
but you never took the time
to whipe my tears.

You sold my soul
for a simple golden ring,
and though all my pain
you never did a thing.

You love that monster
who deserves to die,
every word you ever said
to me itÂ´s all a lie.

How could you never
wanted loved or botherd,
all i ever learnd from you
is how not to be a mother.
