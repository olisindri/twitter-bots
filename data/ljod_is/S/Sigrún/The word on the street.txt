The word on the street

It was the word on the street, 
a new couple had arrived in town 
they seemed very happy, 
and their skin colour was brown. 

Soon their love grew a fruit, 
a new baby was born. 
Something just wasn´t right, 
the dad was out from dusk ´till dawn. 

He cheated on his wife repeatedly, 
almost every night 
the only sound heard from their house 
were the noises of their fight. 

One night the neighbours heard no more, 
he had lost control, called his wife a whore. 
For the beautiful young mother, there was no turning back 
finally she had realized, their lives were seriously off track. 

As she thought of happy they used to be, 
while she tried to take a breath, 
she couldn´t see it coming, 
but the next thing for her was death. 

Her last thoughts were all about 
how one man could chance so fast 
she heard her murderers baby crying 
as she took her last gasp. 

It was the word on the street 
\\\"´till death will do us apart\\\" 
didn´t he feel anything 
in his heart ?
