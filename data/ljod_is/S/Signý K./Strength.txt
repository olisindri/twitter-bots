Strength

Heavenly creature,                                    youÂ´re dying beneath my feet.
I pray for your inner strength
and follow it up
the mountain steep.
You look me in the eyes
as you leave your warmth
for the earth to keep.
Your eyes captured my heart,
the soul beneath
I will again 
...meet.
