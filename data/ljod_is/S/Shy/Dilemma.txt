Dilemma

changes effects us all,
sleeping in daylight, waking in dark.
no normal routine, everything is a mess.
ringing to the office, called in sick.
not true, just trying to make things click
hard to turn around, while stuck to the ground.

lieing on the sofa, watching tv,
but really, there is nothing to see,
constantly more and more tired, 
need soon strength, so i wont get fired.

doorbell ringing, the pizza is here,
cant live like this, its very clear,
have to call boss in his cell.
tell him the truth
face him
so i wont go to hell.

the sun comes up and i sleep
tuesdaymoring, when my phone rings.
my friend, saving the day
she gives me an order, have to obey,
finally get up, in the car,
thank you for this i say.
