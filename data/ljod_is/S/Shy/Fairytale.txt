Fairytale

My mom is cooking dinner,
while waiting for the sitter.
She really want to find some winner,
so she don’t have to be bitter.

Doorbell rings, its goodbye, they’re out.
Gone so fast i can’t even shout:
\"Mom you forgot to say good night\".
Well, sometimes they never get it right.

Again it rings, the sitter walks in.
So lucky that Lucy is sweet.
I told here about my mothers win,
then i found her a story to read.

I wake up from a small dream,
mom and her friend are back.
Suddenly choke, and then loud scream.
Something is not on the right track.

I realize that this guy isn’t very nice.
So i call the police, like i’ve been tought.
He hears me and my head freezes like ice,
So i run fast out, cause i have never fought.

Concerning about my mom,
were i’m lieing on the ground.
People calling: \"where are you Tom?\"
I come out, they gather around

My eyes forced to cry.
My mom has lost her life.
I cry, no matter how hard i try.
And she just wanted to be his wife.
