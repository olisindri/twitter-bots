Searching...

Wherever you are, help me find away.
I really want you to help me.
Sitting by a tree waiting for you to say,
where you want me to be.

Whats my status? Can you please tell.
Its like walking through a wood.
Without water, without cell.
Guide me the way quick, im out of food.

Give me the answer of life,
cause iâ€™m looking for my girl.
I really want to find my wife,
so my heart can be her pearl.
