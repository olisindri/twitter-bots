Long scream

Can’t find a way in the sleep.
Feeling something
running through my body. 
Waking up from a bad dream
Home alone i scream..

Ghosts keep trying breaking in my head
With their sad little souls, trying to spread.
All my happiness, try making their own.
With all the hatred they say im down
But all it is ... it is a bad dream, i scream.

All around me, with tears in their eyes
Sailing through my head, fearing the lies.
The bad and the good feels like nothing,
Nothing, that won’t come into something.

In the morning when i wake up from a dream,
a dream so bad i still have to scream
My weak soul, paralyzed to the bed
Thinking about the things they said.
But all it is my sister, screaming instead

Ghosts of trouble running trough my brain
Keeping it up together
Trying to reach it faster than the rain
While i try to make it better.
