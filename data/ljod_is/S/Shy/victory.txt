victory

now, you’re lonely, not feeling satisfied,
hoping that someone comes visit,
calling the people, you have already tried,
it’s hard cause it feels explicit.

frustrated voice, doesnt want you to bother,
but that doesn’t count for the other,
tears running down to your chin,
unfair, cause you didnt do any sin.

but there is one thing,
you have over them like wing,
this kind heart and patient soul,
that will carry you to the higest pole,
and make you the very best role.

you’ll do this, let them see what i have seen
you can’t hide, just tell them where you’ve been
let them be the the one with the bad thing.
so i can happily laugh in my sing.
