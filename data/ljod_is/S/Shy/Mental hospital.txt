Mental hospital

i was sick but i didnt have a fever.
and i didnt wanna stay at home.
cause all my life i have seen them come.
two and two together.

here were im stuck in this place,
with toilet, bed and no space
and all i can think about
are the things that made be proud.

when ever someone comes visit,
wich happens once in a year,
they have to rely on a glass unit
in case if i use my second gear.

bad people and good people
in this world.
the good ones i never see
but somewhere they exist
were they are ment to be.
