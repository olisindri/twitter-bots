The dark of blue

The dark of blue the dark of nigth 
no where seems to end 
why is there no wrong or rigth 
left for us to mend  

Caos twirling like the sea 
tossing lifes around 
one day earth will let us be 
with one vissous sound 

Only then will there be peace 
Nothing can be done, 
O how the stars will shine again after we have gone. 

The brigthest sun  the warmest ray 
brings us back to life 
but waisted as the time goes by 
again we‚Äùll have to strife.  

Smile a bit just to feel 
collors in your soal 
couse living only a day a time is the strongest goal.
