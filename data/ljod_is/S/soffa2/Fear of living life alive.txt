Fear of living life alive

What is this sense 
that makes us stop?
what is it , we fear?

Ignorence only has contol…
Thers nothing left to shear…

Why cant I run wild with the wolfes
Howling in the nigth
safe in my cave braided with beeds..
keeping away from ligth

I feel so small
I am to kind

Your feesting on, my words 
 Drowning slowly ,, I fall behind
washing your yesterday’s shirts,

Feast on my soal , feast on my heart
Clear all the whits from my mind..
My flesh is bear,,my senses are rear
 Im done with the urge to be kind


I cant see my life as anything real
Vaisted my nigths and my pain…
Pushing myself never to feel
Beleaving I am insane,
Pushing myself never to feel
Beleaving I am insane,
