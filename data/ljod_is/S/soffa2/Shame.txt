Shame

As we lay down i hope inside
that´ u wont run away 
but we both know betwen us now
there´s nothing left to say  
I make beleve u ceare for me 
as u act along, we make our love in diferent ways 
and smile as nothings wrong 

Hold on to me  o dont let go,,, 
love me just for now    
please i know  one day u will... 
you just dont know how  

With all the love in this world 
mine is just to give 
couse i know by heart if u wern´t here 
i dont think i could live  

All my pride is gone away 
i kling on to a dream 
pretending things are never more 
as painfull as they seem  

My love just go,,  
ill cry for us ....as i free the pain 
nothing in our life is true  
theres nothing left to gain..........
