She...

She.

No one knows her.
No one cares.
Inside she's lonley.
Inside she's dead.

She walks alone.
Where no one can see her.
She's here and she's gone.
She's a ghost with no home.

Screaming where no one hear's her.
Bleeding where no one feels her.
Wanting attention she ends her pain.
And so ends her game.
