Born to be born again.

There is always time
to turn around
and higher learning
to be found.
From heavens door
celestial sound
for rich and poor
on holy ground.

Walk the path of life
with care
there is so much
that we can share.
On earth is strive
perhaps not so fair
but all worthwhile
when we get there.

Flowers,trees and clear blue sky
there is no better way to die
in arms of loved ones
the last goodbye.
Then spirits slowly
come to you
nothing more
on earth to do.

Angeles great your 
arrival there
thru open door
you hear the sphere
playing music
loud and clear
of love and light
there is no fear.

You have reached the home
of joy and dreams
that life on earth
now only seems
a part of puzzle
that truely means
the reason why
to love gods will.

He touches us
in different way
to me and you
He wants to say
love each other
every day
and teach your children
about my way.
