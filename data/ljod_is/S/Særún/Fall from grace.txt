Fall from grace

You broke my heart and left me to die.
Our life torn apart I\'ve lived in a lie.
Something so cherished changed over night
Oh- what a feeling in the deep darkest night.

Used to believe that love was so strong
never felt lonely or left without words
There is something so terribly wrong
in a heart of human, the pain is the sword.

I went through the stargate of Heavens Door 
then God came to rescue my soul from the FALL.
He showed me what is the most important of all
to help and to heal, and to love evermore.
