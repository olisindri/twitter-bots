Angel of Light

When I look to the future and think about you 
  The golden hair Maiden in all that you do 
  The shining surrounds your being so bright 
  Flowers and trees bathe in your shimmering light.

  You are the Angel of Heaven and Earth 
  God blessed you at the moment of birth 
  He looks after you and all those we Love 
  His sign is the fluttering wings of a Dove.

  Whenever the Angels sing to His Praise
  Remember the Rainbow born in His face
  You are the daughter of the Living Light
  That is the most wonderful sight.

  Take these words and know that Iâ€™m here
  Only a thought away, always so near.
  I love you my angel more than words ever say
  I wish you the most wonderful Christmas Day.

  With all my Love to you.
