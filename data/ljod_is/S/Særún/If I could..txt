If I could.

If I could be the stars        
I would shine for you,
So brightly that your walk
Thru life could be easyer.

If I could be the sun
I would shine on you
Warm up your heart,
And melt the ice away.

If I could be the rain
I would sprinkle my drops
On your tired soul
So it could bloom again.

If I could be mother earth
I would take you in my arms
Embrace your being,
So you felt secure again.
