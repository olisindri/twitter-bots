Time to die ?

My soul is soaring high above
floating in the sky 
Colors shining like the rainbow
it is my time to die.

I´ll leave this earth so silently
show up at heavens door
I´ve waited "oh so patiently"
and figured out "what for"

My role is over -the play is done
no need for helping hands
In the morning I will be gone 
into the angels land.
