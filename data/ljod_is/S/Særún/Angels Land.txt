Angels Land

My soul is soaring high above
floating in the sky. 
Colours shining like the rainbow
it is my time to die.

I will leave this earth so silently
show up at heavens door.
I waited \"oh so patiently\"
and figured out  \"what for\"

My role is over -the play is done
no need for helping hands.
In the morning I will be gone 
into the Angels Land
