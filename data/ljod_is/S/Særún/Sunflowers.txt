Sunflowers

The memory of you is sweet 
Like a sunflower in the sun, 
spreading it\'s paddles 
around my heart.  
 
Once again I have been touched 
with the harps, 
of beauty that belongs 
In The Eye of the Beholder. 
 
The sound of your soul 
vibrates in my heart, 
tells me the secrets 
of your future.
