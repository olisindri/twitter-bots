Incomplete soul

Like a rose without red
Like a statement unsaid
Like a page filled with words
but Iâ€™m empty instead
Like a cold wintertime
never followed by spring
Like a few words on paper
could mean anything

Like a sun without beams
I\'m asleep without dreams
Like the water were missing
in rivers and streams
Like the thousands of lies
that used to be true
Like an incomplete soul
I am without you
