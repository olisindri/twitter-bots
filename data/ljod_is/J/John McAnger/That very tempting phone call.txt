That very tempting phone call

Come on, ride with me!
We’ll solve our mysteries
like Scooby-Doo,
& you know who...
-Could it be; eternity?
He doesn’t see, he doesn’t hear;
he doesn’t think the end is near.

Working\' hard or hardly working\'?
-He doesn’t really talk that much, nor sing.
Spreading diseases
& blowing to pieces...
Celebrating victory with democracy
is history’s biggest hypocrisy.

-Over & out and march me over!
Freedom is as rare as a four-leaf clover.
Too many guns to kill,
too much blood’s been spilled...
-If he doesn’t see & he doesn’t hear,
he doesn’t think the end is near.
