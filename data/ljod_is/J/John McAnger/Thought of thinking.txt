Thought of thinking

If the day today was the day tomorrow,
would you join me in a walk of crime?
If the day tomorrow was the day of sorrow,
would you help me kill the time?

If the years to come are the years weâ€™ve followed,
will they still hold the same fences?
If those years to come will be as shallow,
then when will we come to our senses?
