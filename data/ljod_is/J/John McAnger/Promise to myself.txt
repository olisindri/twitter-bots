Promise to myself

I am here but you are there,
these people aren’t going anywhere.
I feel my mind is about to scatter
but January will make it better.

I wish I hadn’t been so late.
Still this decision you’ve already made.
Gather all your stars together
for the men are predicting bad weather.

Please don´t talk or make a sound
‘cuz true happiness I’ve already found.
I hope we´ll meet again in December,
if I don\'t forget, I will remember.
