The heavenly queens stone

In ways I can’t explain,
I’ve found peace; got rid of pain.
Everything is now & forever,
always has, yet also never.

      -it’s strange, how we seem
       to be prearranged in shame…
       so, who’s to blame?

Heavenly blue as the clearest sky,
your blossom pours out from your eyes.

Blond hair, blue eyes
I believe those are yours.
The kind that saves lives,
truly; your optical doors.
Writings from past times
in our God’s alphabet-rules.
Your grace all around shines
without a word nor even a move.

Justice for your glory
& justice for your fate.
I know it’s not our time
that’s my reason to hate.
