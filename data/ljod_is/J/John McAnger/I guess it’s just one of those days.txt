I guess it’s just one of those days

I hate the moon & I hate the sun.
I hate the clouds, every single one.
I hate the cold & I hate the heat.
& I really hate the rain that falls on the street.
I hate the autumn & I hate the spring.
I hate the year and it’s stupid ring.
I hate the ground & I hate the sky.
Today I hate you all – but I don’t know why…
