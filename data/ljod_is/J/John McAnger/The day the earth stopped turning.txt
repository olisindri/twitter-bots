The day the earth stopped turning

The sun is bleeding diamonds,
	and the moon starts to cry.
It’s pretty hard to take
	to watch your sister die.

	- Staring into a black universe,
	that collapses under fear.
	 Moaning out it’s last thoughts,
	as death follows near.

Rises up from his evil inside,
	so dark, so deep, yet so tall.
Following only the soles of sin
	he reaches for us all.

Fighting the core of our earth,
	living on all of our days.
Breathing flames of burning fire
	his anger on us he lays.

Intoxicating our children,
	& destroying our minds.
We walk out the gallows
	leaving all of ours behind.

Into the night we’ve vanished,
	left the colourful dance.
Beaten brutally down
	by his violent ignorance.
