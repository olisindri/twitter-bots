Loneliness

Shadow creatures of every size,
break the silence of stillborn cries.
– Suddenly I hear an echo from a baby, crying
         as it haunts me; I feel my sole dieing.

Now, the Exodus isn’t far away,
Genesis was yesterday.
      I pray and I pray!
Oh Lord, can’t you hear what I have to say?

I see life’s reflection in the wind,
it reminds me of my deadly sins.
My eyes try up & I feel the spirit fly by,
touch my back and I wonder; why?

Now, it all is to far away
no one remembers yesterday.
       I pray and I pray!
Oh Lord can’t you hear what I have to say?
