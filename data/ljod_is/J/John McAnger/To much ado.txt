To much ado

I never give, I only take.
Well sometimes I give promises;
Which I only brake.
¯ I sense a defeat
in a war that hasn’t started:
	My conscience & wisdom;
	for a long time been parted.
Feel the wrath of my tongue
in my melancholic voice.
Lets finish while we’re young,
bring on the noise.
I see, you see, together we see:
Our love, getting lost at the bottom of the sea.
