Ode to the Natives

Growing food in their backyard,
in the front they’re mining gold.
Talking peace with their neighbors;
the air is far from cold.

Building futuristic buildings;
in history left untold.
Their society was beautiful,
now their culture has been sold.

Sailing across the whole Atlantic,
packed with diseases & guns to blow.
With only one thing on their minds;
to find some land & growth, you know.

Invading those beautiful nations,
taking all they had to give.
Starting cutting down the people,
letting nobody to live.

¯

When will this nonsense come to an end?
Can the dictatorship be stopped?
We’ve burned up all their history,
on saving it we flopped.

They’re not gone but still forgotten
& their land the white man craves.
Starting war within their nations;
in the end them no one saves.
