Lonely Blind Girl

Aside from a low, lonely whisper, 
she hears a strange noize;
a hammering sound of desolution
-it´s her brain.
Nowhere around 
is her red, lovely sweater. 
Still, she bares no hate,
towards us nor against us. 
Becouse, hate only leads away, 
not the right way; just far, 
far from here, to a different day.

Her voice is deep & low
yet she´s 8 miles high
from artificial snow;
she touches the sky.

Colors of spoken language,
she knows not to sence;
leaking sounds, rising grounds,
she smells happiness & thinks of righteusness.

Then, through time´s endless circle, 
she leaps, or at least she tries to; 
but she tumbles. 
rolles & crumbles,
& though she rises, 
still she stumbles. 

So, she has a brand new vision 
on the mental obsession 
that makes her mind 
find a thought of depression.

Another dimension 
with greater expansion
gives her a taste 
of an eternal solution.
It´s a better place 
for her race 
or at least 
that´s what she
chooses 
to belive.
