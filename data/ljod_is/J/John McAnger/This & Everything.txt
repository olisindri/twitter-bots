This & Everything

Open eyes that gaze at me,
shadows running on the wall.
Paranoia drags me down;
No one will ever hear me call.
-Spider spins her masterpiece,
we are friends, or so it seems.
We talk of politics & sins,
we talk of this & everything.

-\"The moon is shining, stars are bright.\"
Someone is leaving for the door.
Our spirit talks of disbelieve
´cuz noone knows him anymore.
-“My greatest friend is myself,
I don’t need anybody else.
I know my politics & sins,
I know this & everything”.
