For The Youth

I sit down to write this for the ones of the youth
for I think it´s my duty to try’to tell them the truth.
Of what the real world really is to,
there´s so much disorder but yet nothin to prove.
Some sense them, some don´t 
and some know they are there;
thus making of evil, witch we all do despair.
       Those who bare nothing of love & good deeds,
       those who discomfort us planting our seeds.
Is their mission this obvious; to put us aside
& lock as many up forever to hide?
       Oppress the free thinking & controll the press
       and to brainwash the puplic with their politic-chess?
I guess I´ll never know so I encourige you
to open your eyes; try to seek out the truth.
With these final words jolly wishes I send
to all who are trying to see it throuh to the end.
