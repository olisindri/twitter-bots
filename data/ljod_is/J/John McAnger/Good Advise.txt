Good Advise

I try and I try, but my mind I can´t find.
Any questions unanswered are all left behind.
However, this one I ask you and answer it true;
who is more human, is it me or is it you?

I lay alone and tremble from worries and fear,
my imagination has gone far - yet so near.
I can´t bare the fact that the undone is not,
so I must accept that unforgivable plot.

I´ve been just a pessant for twenty long years,
sentanced to stagger for what the puplic most fears.
I´ve tried \'to live by their laws & their rules;
I´ve paid them my taxes, I´ve tended their schools.

Now, looking upon our crusified man
who they say dit not follow our Gods masterplan.
But the thing is my children, my women and men
the one thing he dit was us to defend.

Just open your eyes, you will see it so clear.
Just open your ears and you clearly will hear;
there ain´t much time left; the end, it is near
but if you follow the right path there´s nothing to fear.
