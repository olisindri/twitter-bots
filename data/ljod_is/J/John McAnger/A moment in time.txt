A moment in time

She says to me she bares a name from above;
runes, written by god.
Her presence, delightful; she steals my eyes.
        For a moment in time
        but forever on my mind.

Together we travel through all sorts of images.
With spiritual privileges
we float alone with nowhere behind.
        For a moment in time
        but forever on my mind.

Though I know, I still can’t say it,
or explain this one single thought.
She enslaves my mind completely,
        dips in it deeply,
        converts it neatly.

And I think I may have to say
it’s to a better way
in getting through the day - unchained.
	For just a moment in time,
	though forever on my mind.
