Calling God

Come meet me, please feed me of your stories so true.
You know, I’d been long gone if it wasn’t for you.
-	I’ll tell you this much of the world you live in:
	There’s no room for good, it’s so full of sin.

Come find me, please mind me when I beg for Thee.
I feel so reclusive, I’ll never be free.
-	We’ve all been pre-punished for all of our crimes,
	that’s why I know how to handle hard times.

Come see me, please free me from this terrible pain.
I don\'t have much left, there’s no time to explain.
I’ve lived through my live maybe to blindly,
so the only thing I know there ain’t that much to see.

You know, when I wrote this I was as sober as hell,
you can’t find any other this story to tell.
I’ve been put here to die, I’ve been left here to weep,
for cross-firing nations my wisdom to weak.
