Long live Liberty!

I live alone; I’ve never had a home.
I don’t own many clothes; I’m only skin & bones.
For all my live I’ve been completely on my own…
And it’s now time to say goodbye and go.

I feel so sad; true joy I’ve never had
and I’ve tried to hide it by always acting glad.
I wish that I had never played that game…
‘Cus now and forever will ever be the same.

Gone by so fast, this day will be my last.
As I lay dieing, I think about my past.
Now as I go, I want the world to know:
Who you think is your friend is more likely be foe…
