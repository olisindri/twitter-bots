The Wait

I sit here alone,
waiting for a call.
Drank a lot of Jack last night,
but that don\'t matter at all.
I’d like another cigarette;
I gave my last one away.
Hey, if my call will come in time,
could I speak with Dylan, O.K.?

        So, away I flow,
        and like Bobby said:
       “One more cup of coffee before I go”.
        My gun I reload,
        and like Bobby said:
       “One more cup of coffee before the road”.

If my call doesn’t come on through,
if the operator says no,
would you run down to my coffee-shop
& quickly let me know?
Because if I didn’t know in time
I would wait for so many years,
hoping for that one phone call;
to hear Dylan’s voice in my ear.

        Now further I go,
        and like Bobby said:
       “One more cup of coffee for the road”.
        My gun I reload,
        and like Bobby said:
       “One more cup of coffee before I go,
        to the valley below”.
