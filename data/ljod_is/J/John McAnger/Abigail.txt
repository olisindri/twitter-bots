Abigail

Humour enlightening & easy
keeps my heart from totally freezing.
Ivory white skin
& aroma of spring
your closeness; well gratifying.

Vivid your glow, soft & fair face,
you represent the meaning of grace.
Youâ€™re a flake of snow
& no evil you know
only love inside you grows.

Ruby red lips, magical eyes
Hair, as bright as a surprise
Diamond like smile
& like the Nazis said: Hail!
I honour you sweet Abigail.
