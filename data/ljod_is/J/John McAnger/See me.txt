See me

See me trying.
Trying to make the world a better place to live in.
See me crying,
& fighting the armies whoâ€™re frying,
every little thing that has never made a sin.
See me walking.
Walking forward to the bitter end.
See me talking.
Talking to somebody I thought was a friend.
See me setting my goal higher.
Higher than no time known before.
See me try a little harder,
harder than anyone just to score.

Every time I try to make myself clearer,
someone drags me nearer,
nearer to the darkness of the world
which none but he understands.
