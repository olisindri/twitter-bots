I’m Leaving

Try to wake but I fall asleep,
I’ve been here for way to long.
Lost my faith & believe,
think terrible thoughts
all about different odds.

Try to stay but then I go again,
it’s hard to leave, my love.
But strangest things seem so good,
even though many are bad
–worse things I’ve never had.

Far away the light begins to shine
and I float into the fog.
Reasons not given, nor explained,
I feel good but not for long.
When you get here, I’ll be gone.

It’s hard to see or even to feel,
        forget my loss.
It’s hard to take, don\'t start to cry,
        don’t make such a fuzz.
Just go back to sleep, I’ll be in your dreams
        to bring you relief.
Now, it’s my time to go
        & I want you to know
        that it’s not bad at all.
