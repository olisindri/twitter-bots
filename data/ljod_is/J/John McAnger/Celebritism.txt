Celebritism

Walking on the other side of nowhere,
waiting for my train to come,
to take me far away from here.

I’ve spent all of my life to get here
but now I’ve changed my mind;
now I want to go back home again.

       One time isn’t always always,
       two times make it more
       & the third time makes it one more day alone.

I left all of my loved ones,
my family, friends and Jane
for this world and I regret it every day.

My train doesn’t seem to be coming,
well, that’s my own damn fault.
I’m going to be stuck here for all my days.

       Because one time isn’t always always,
       but two times make it more,
       & the third time makes it one more day alone.
