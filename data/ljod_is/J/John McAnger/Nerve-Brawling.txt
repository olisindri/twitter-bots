Nerve-Brawling

Feeling unknown begin to rise
and they’ll stay with me this time.
At first, I recognize my pride,
then I loose my mind.
After all, I’m just a man,
I have to understand.

I think it’s love, but then again
it could be hate, my dear old\' friend.
Sometimes I can’t tell those things apart,
but that’s my choice of art.
After all, I’m just a man,
you have to understand.

We’re all condemned; we’re all confused,
we’re all alone, with nothing to lose.
We must accept their wicked games,
which they play, all in our names.
After all, we’re all human,
we have to understand.
