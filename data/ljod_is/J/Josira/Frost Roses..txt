Frost Roses.

Frost roses in a window
come when temperature is low.
You just sit there
and watch in it slow.

A world full of fairy-tale
encourages you to go.
Into magical places
let your imagination flow.

Your journey will take you
on the charming move.
Into the world
you have never knew

As the moonlight come near
like a beautiful chrystal clear.
Is the frost roses in rime,
natures art you enjoy this time.
