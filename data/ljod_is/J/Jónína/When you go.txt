When you go

I want to say Hello,
Before you go  
I am crazy in my head,
It is your fault

I'm lost in Hollywood
Can you found my,
I'm so not cool
And I lost my brotherhood

I want to say I do,
I want to say I love you.

When you go 
Can you say hello?
But I am lost in Hollywood
And I am so not cool.
