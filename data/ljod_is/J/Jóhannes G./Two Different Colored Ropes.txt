Two Different Colored Ropes

We are tied together
With two different ropes
Tied well by memory
No hopes

Still I love you my dear
According to Mr. Hyde
And the holy liquid 
I want you at my side

Speak freely, speak for yourself
Act as you, and act as me
wipe my fake plastic tears
Can we ever be?
