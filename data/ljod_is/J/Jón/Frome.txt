Frome

Take your youth away,
and give it to the man
who walks alone, 
alone down a dark road.

Take your breath away,
and give it to the lady
who gives her word for eternity,
eternity to the valley of the dead.

Take your time 
doing these things,
for I will give your sole piece,
by burying my axe in your head.
