What is this, what is that?
Sitting in the dark 
I ask my self this question 
over and over again... 
This is this, 
and that is that. 
I hear comming from the walls... 
But there isn´t 
anybody there. 
So I hold my breath down, 
hoping I can kill my self 
that way but every time I do it 
someone interups me... 
Little, 
purple, 
shining creature, 
who are you? 
Are you the one,
the one who gets me there in the end? Then why don´t you 
let me do it? 
Just let me die! 
Let me end it, 
like everyone else 
who are locked up 
in this white room! 
Ooohh! 
I can´t take it any more! 
I want it so badly, 
to die... 

The next morning the dark is darker then dark and death is deader than dead...
