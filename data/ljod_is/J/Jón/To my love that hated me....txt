To my love that hated me...

I said a lot of things to you,
they were bad and of corse not true,
and now I am fealing really sad,
for all the stupid thing I earlier said.
In these words I am telling you why,
why I hate my self and I want to die...

So when I finally drop down dead,
with a 22.caliber bullet in my head,
and beside me there\'s lieing a note,
a note I crying to you wrote,
and when you read it you will know why,
why I hated my self and I wanted to die...

Becouse of us...
