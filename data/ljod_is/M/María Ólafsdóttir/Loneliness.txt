Loneliness

This loneliness, this loneliness within,
my heart.

There is no way to explain with words. 
No reason at all to see
Why this loneliness is there within, 
within the midst of me.
When I’m lying, here alone, 
I let it go and cry,
There is no point in asking me, 
I just don’t know, why?
