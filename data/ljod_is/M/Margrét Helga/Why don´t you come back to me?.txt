Why don´t you come back to me?

Every minute´s like an hour
Every hour´s like a day
Every day is like a month
When you are far away
I feel like I´ve been waiting...for many years

Why don´t you come back?
Why don´t you come back to me?
Why don´t you come back?
Why don´t you come back to me?

I sit here in the shadow
Still thinking of you
My life isn´t the same
When I´m not with you
I feel like I´ve been waiting...for many years.
