Falling inlove

There are some things I have to say
But I can´t say, ´cause I am afraid
of you would laugh at me

There are some words I wanna say
But I can´t say, ´cause I am afraid
of losing you for good

But I…
Am falling inlove with you
I´m falling inlove

And I…
I´m falling in love with you
I´m falling inlove

Would you tell me I´m a child
Or would you laugh, or would you love me too?
I really hope you do

And I hope that you can see
That you will always be a part of me
Even though you don´t love me

But I...
Am falling inlove with you
I´m falling inlove
