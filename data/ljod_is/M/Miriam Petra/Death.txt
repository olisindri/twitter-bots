Death

Perhaps they who are blinded by money and wealth
and have lost the knowledge of the fact
that love truly is the essence of life,
would choose eternal life. 
But we who are blessed with that knowledge
should value the gift of life; death.
It is because of death we can be with our 
loved ones through all eternity in Paradise.
