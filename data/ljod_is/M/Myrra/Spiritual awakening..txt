Spiritual awakening.

Silent stillness floating through my vains,
that bright new feeling only god explains.
My chains surrenderd,fell firmly on the ground,
they went with shame,are nowhere to be found.
No longer bound i walk to brighter days,
and the rocky road i finally dare to face.
Embrace that stillness if it comes to you,
and to your god be faitfully loyalÂ´n true.
