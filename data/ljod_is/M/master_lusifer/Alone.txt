Alone

Underneath the blue sky, the wind blows towards the future as if to draw the rays of the sun into an embrace. I just let it push me around leaving only my footprints behind. If i have the air to stroke my cheek and soft grass to fall down on i donÂ´t need anything else. Sleeping with a contented smile. I stare into tomorrow that stretches on endlessly. I know that my love fore you will never end.
