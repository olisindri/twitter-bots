The knight of my dreams

Lay awake, hope I die
Why am I open, but so shy.
Want to drown my sorrows in your arms
And I know, In you hands I can not be harmed

I think of you as my merciful black knight
That saves me from the madness, and carries me in to the night
Why cant my thoughts never be true?
Why cant I never really have you?
