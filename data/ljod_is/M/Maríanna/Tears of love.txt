Tears of love

Hide in my shell
Wept my lonely tears.
In this life of hell
No one can understand my fears.

Can\'t come out.
Your name I shout.
But you donâ€™t come to me.
So from this life I try to flee.

Awaken from the dead,
you linger above me.
Sad tears you have shed, 
for you are, the one who loves me.
