I don\'t understand

Why can\'t I be like the other girls?
Why won\'t kids play with me?
Why are they always teasing me?
Why can\'t sadness let me be?

Why am I so fat and ugly?
Why can\'t mom just stop and hug me?
Why is my sister always so mad?
Did I do some thing wrong? Am I bad?

Why is mommy some times sad?
What did I do that is so bad?
I don\'t understand 
What did I do?
Did I do some thing to you?

Why do I always feel so low?
Why do I watch T.V. all day long?
Why do I eat to ease my sorrow?
Where the hell do I belong?
