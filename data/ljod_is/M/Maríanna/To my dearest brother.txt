To my dearest brother

Oh brother dearest,
I love you so.
This motion is the clearest.
Don\'t you ever go.

Oh brother dearest
Life has always been mad
whatever you do, 
I will always love you,
even though your heart is sad.

Oh brother dearest,
from me you went.
I cried, but tearless,
and to you, a sad song I sent.

Oh brother dearest,
why did you leave?
I know, life is the meanest,
but why did you have to go away from me?
