Dear little friend

“I will not cry, I will not brake,
I will not shad a tear,
I hope it’s a lie, I hope it’s fake
I start to shake in fear.

She hammers and hammers me, up and down
As my tears start to fall, on to the ground 
But I can just hope, hope I will not drown.
Please don’t let them hear my sand little sound.

A friend takes my hand and shows me mercy
“Make her stop”, I cry, but she can not hear me
My friend stars to sop and begs me not to cry.
“Please god, please, let me die!” “


I felt your pain 
Go through my vain
When I saw your sad face
In that awful place   

Please little friend, forgive me for not knowing,
The sad little girl you dare not showing.
I hope I can know her, I hope she’s true.
But the only thing I want to know, I want to know you.
