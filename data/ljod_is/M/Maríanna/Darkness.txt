Darkness

Darkness is so mysterious and pretty to some
But to me it’s mad, and it makes me feel numb 
I hate to feel the darkness overwhelm me 
But people not see what it does to me.

The darkness holds death, pain and fear
But when I feel those, I don’t want people near
I don’t want them to know who I really am.
This small, weak little lamb.

Who is the darkness to make me feel this way.
I want to feel loved, beautiful and gay.
I hate this damn darkness
I hate this fucking madness
But the thing I hate most is the overwhelming sadness.
