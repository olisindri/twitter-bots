Love is...

Love is when you touch me,
Love is when you care, 
Love is when you kiss me,
Love is when you stop and stair.

Love is something you can not handle 
Love is when you light some candles
Love is when ones kiss
will live you in the bliss.

Love is in the flowers, 
Love is in the showers. 
Love is in the bed, 
And love can hit you in the head.

Love is in truth
Love is in you,
Love is in happiness
Love is, I have no clue.
