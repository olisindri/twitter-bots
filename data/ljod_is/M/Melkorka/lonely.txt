lonely

Walking thousand miles as tired I can be.
I’m walking the road again, because your not here with me.
Can’t you see that I’m crying?
Why can’t you just be here and hold me
´cause I need it.

I’m on my own again and I’m feeling so alone.
I want to hear your voice but I can’t pick up the phone.
Why’s the life so confusing?
Can’t I just say to you that I’m sorry?
´cause I mean it.

I didn’t ever think about how the love could be so hard
I see I’m really losing you and it’s tearing me apart
Why can I just stop crying?
What can I say to you, please forgive me
´cause I need you.
