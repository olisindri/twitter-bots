My Way

Emo freak,
They like to say,
Write and cut,
It's what she does all day.

The people stare,
And like to point,
At this girl who is nothing more,
than a little disjoint.

More than nothing,
It's what she wants to be, 
Absolutely anything,
Other than what they see.

Blackened eyes,
Blackened heart,
She slowly dies,
And falls apart.
