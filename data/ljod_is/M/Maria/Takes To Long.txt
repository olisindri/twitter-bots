Takes To Long

You feel the pressure?
Feel the sweat run down and the forbidden tears build?
Your hand leaves the mascara mess
youre fingers wiping the dust of your emedded desk
and you find the sharp edge, the sharp slice of your wrist-
you look up to the sky as the pain overrides
and wish you were somewhere else, anywhere but this.
