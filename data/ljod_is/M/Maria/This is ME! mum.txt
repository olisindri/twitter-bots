This is ME! mum

You say I'm silly
You say that I act
Well what is it now, mom,
This is me! More than a fact!

Fuck you for not believing!
For only caring when I was in the wrong,
Never there when I needed you,
To make me strong!

You have made me what I am!
Filled with HATE!
Don't look back now,
Its too fucking late!

When I was born,
Did you cry or rejoice?
Was I the unwanted one?
Was it even youre fucking choice?

You should have cut me then,
Made things less hard!
For now that im older,
I UNDERSTAND 

To be unwanted,
by the one that you love,
is a fuckin wake up call,
to the PERSON ABOVE!
