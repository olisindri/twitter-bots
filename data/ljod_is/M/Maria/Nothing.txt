Nothing

Have you ever felt
like you are nothing?
Have you ever felt 
that everything about you
is wrong?
You look like shit,
everyday people look at you,
because you are different.
If so, how did you feel?
Did it make you feel
bad, sad or lonely?
Did it make you feel
glad, happy or relifed?
It made me feel like
Nothing..
