life

Wondering is life is a lie,
Or should i just die.
Maby people thing iÂ´m suiside,
But really trying to find,
A purpos to life.

Is life about love & affection,
Or is it abour Hate & betrail,
All i know is death is a coinsidens,
But life is meant to be.

But life is a thriller,
You never know,
What will happen to the,
