Living

Why do we stop living ,
Why do we live at all.
CanÂ´t God just spair us,
The agony of it all.

Why is there pain,
And why is the joy,
Where can we,
Comeplete it all.

If we would be angels.
Would er have to go,
Through it all.
If we would be Devils,
Would ther be pain,
Waiting for us all.
