Heart-dust

Heart-dust

Who ever wrote
?It?s better to have loved and lossed,
than ever to have loved at all?
never knew love

The loss is greater
Than love can ever be
The numbness that follows
Overtakes the possibility, love ever offered

Numbness and stagnation
Offer solitude and peace
Lost love offers little
But a reminder of ?never again?

Lost love though offers 
encasement of feelings
That will never be felt again
It?s closed of, turned to ruins

The sole reminder
That we ever existed
Closed of forever
Never again
