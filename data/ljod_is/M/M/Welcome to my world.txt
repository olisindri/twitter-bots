Welcome to my world

She has sixteen roses on the floor
one for every year she's got
Don't know why ?
She feels so old

Knows she's all alone

Don't know why 
she feels this way
knows she has is all up made
knows she is one of those 
that never find their way
back home

Got no lovers 
got some friends 
but they won't ever 
make it better
'Cause how are they to know
what troubles her little head and soul

They don't ever
see inside
the life I live
and noone ever will

I am frightened
I'm alone 
I got noone in this world
'cause this world is full of fools

Welcome to my world
