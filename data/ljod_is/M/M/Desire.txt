Desire

The emptiness 
must be filled
the longing, overwhelming 
the desires of being alone

The hope for joy
the need for love
surprising, unarmed heart
open to all

Asking now to hold it softly
it?s bruised and not too trusting
The bleak glimmer
dimmed by hate

Will you be the one
to unlock the desire
the desire to be at one with all
to have more than a glimmer 

To have it all
