Signal lost

Cloudy sky obscuring the stars
            The signal lost
      How do I know where you are?

     Although night and almost dark
 the alit sky, the colour of orange-aide
      Makes me wonder how you are

         The feelings exploding
            A comet appears
            It's my emotions

         Can you see from afar?
