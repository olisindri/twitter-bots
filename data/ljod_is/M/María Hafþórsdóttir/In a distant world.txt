In a distant world

In a distant world
guarded by the silent being of the stars

Lies forever a piece of my soul
next to your heart

Dreaming of your presence, I see our spirits joined
in the heavenly skies that lie over the oceans between us

Like a blessing of the sun as it touches the face of the earth
I think of your gentle touch on my cheek at farewell

Perhaps in our own world – that in time may become
we will be one – for eternity
