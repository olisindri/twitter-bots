Man , I´m tired

Spending my whole life alone,
wasting endless time.
Rejecting all the love you´ve shown,
do you think it is a crime ?

I will not be tempted by
the promises you make,
I don´t need another guy 
who´s only out to take

You´re not welcome on my boat,
I never invited you to stay,
So baby, why don´t you hit the road
and find an easier prey.
