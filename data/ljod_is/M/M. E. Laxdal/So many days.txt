So many days

So many days
have I flown over oceans
above
the comforting ambience
of the extreme freedom
that cradles my joy

So many nights
have I lain in the shadows
beneath
the flickering lightspots
on the darkened sheet
that covers my sorrow

In the twilight
the day meets the night
they fall in love
and part together
leaving only 
faint traces of daybreak
