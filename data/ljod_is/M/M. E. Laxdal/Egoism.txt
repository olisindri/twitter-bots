Egoism

blow out the candlelight
kill the stars
rape the moon and
wash out the sun
- I don't care

blow up the busses
shoot the policemen
kidnap the president and
rob the banks
- I don't give a shit

hurt your loved ones
cheat on your mate
be mean and ruthless
and sell your soul
- I really don't mind

burn the books
tear up the paintings
go for tyranny
and become a slave
- I don't give a damn

but spit in my face
or step on my toes
dare stealing my heart
or punch in my nose
- and I'll do you in, punk !
