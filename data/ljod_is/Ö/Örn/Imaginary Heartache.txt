Imaginary Heartache

every day i try to wake up
but i cant because i miss you so
(miss you so)
you are never here when i need you baby
you are always somewhere else
(never here)
i am gonna go away for awhile because
i cannot do this anymore
(never more)

and i start to 
shiver
afraid that i will die alone
shiver
when you left me here to bleed
bleeding
im feeling better when i sing
(when i sing)  oh oh ohh

every day i try to wake you up
but i cant because you are gone
(you are gone)
you are never here when i want to kiss you baby
you have left me now
(im all alone)
im gonna fly away , im gonna die
because i cannot do this anymore
(im dying slow)

and i start to 
panic
i am gonna die alone
panic
im never gonna see the light
singing
trying to wake up from this

every day i try to wake up
but i cant because i miss you so
(i miss you babe)...
