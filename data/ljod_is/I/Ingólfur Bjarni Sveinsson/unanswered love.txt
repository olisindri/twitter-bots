unanswered love

in the fields of love, your heart will stay forever
depart from each other, they can by god never
you were made for him, and he was made for you
always to each other, shall thy be true
forgive past arguments, leave them behind
embrace the future, and constant love you will find

still remember that, both intent to be right
that can easily, start up a fight
so surround positive energy, around your souls
then together you can, accomplice your goals

but don’t forget your friend, that easily breaks
the one who’s feelings, he never fakes
never his spirit, you would do any bad
nor his emotions, bring down sad
then for eternity, he shall stay your friend
give you friendship, even death cannot end
