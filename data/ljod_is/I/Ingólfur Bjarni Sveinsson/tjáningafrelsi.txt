my sweetheart,
my flower so full of life
you cut through my heart like a knife

you bring it to a hault
our end i hate, where was the fault

i waited, i waited for you so long
what happened, what did i do wrong

who is it, can it be your friend to blame
does she play with you,
play your desires as they were a game

i always go back, back to your arm(s)
my love, that brings me so much harm

pain and sorrow,
i smile when i see your face
the depth of your eyes
the brightness of your gace
i try to believe your words were lies

wish we were like four weeks ago
you held my hand as we were walking
smiled as we were talking

the taste of your lips
the touch of your hips

the freedome of speech in your room
now just a memory, lifeless like a toom

those now fading away in the summer heat
my heart for you it stoppes to beat
