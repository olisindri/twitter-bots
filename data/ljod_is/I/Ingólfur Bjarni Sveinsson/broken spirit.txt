broken spirit

I want to lie, all day in bed
dark clouds are, surrounding my head
no one, I ever want to speak
cause my will, all is so weak
emotions are, at their highest peak
want forever, to fall asleep
need someone, around me to hold
take my sorrow, and it unfold

how can few words, be so hurting
it all started, with simple flirting
those last days, the sun shining high
then you ended it, I dont know why

now my mind is, totally blind
ways to leave, it tries to find
what others will feel, I do not care
cause without you, I cannot bear
