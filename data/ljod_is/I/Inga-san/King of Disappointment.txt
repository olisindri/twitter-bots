King of Disappointment

He’s the King of Disappointment
In the castle of hope
You see him wave his wand
And lie until he chockes
His kingdom is a poor one
His people down on luck
He’s almost like decease
That kills from the inside out.

He rages a war on his nemesis
The Queen of hope she is
He sends his soldiers to break her down
To bend her to her knees
Maybe time has worn on her
Cause the hope is not as bright
The kingdom is getting colder now
With the lack of light.

So what happens to the people now?
They walks around in the dark,
Maybe they’ll build a future kingdom
But will it have the light?
