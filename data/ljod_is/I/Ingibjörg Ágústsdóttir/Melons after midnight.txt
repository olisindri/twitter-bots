Melons after midnight

Eating melons after midnight
a sort of aftermath to making love.

I taste their sweetness
moist as your tongue on my neck
soft as your hand on my breast.

Their succulent sap
falls from our kiss.
Their tender flesh
delicious—strange 
melts in my mouth. 

Melons after midnight:
an exotic touch 
of love’s embrace
sweeter than all.
