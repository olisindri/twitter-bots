Ghost of my heart

I dreamt of you last night
an unwanted ghost of the heart
coming to me in the darkness of dreams
claiming the rights of a memory 
not easily dismissed

Felt your tongue on my breasts
heard your breath filled with promises
ran my hands through your hair
warmed by your sweat on my lips
your skin against mine

And as I woke 
I remembered your words on that day
so solemn and cruel and full of your self-justification
crushing our future of sweet possibility

Ghost of my heart
I can still see the blue of your eyes
