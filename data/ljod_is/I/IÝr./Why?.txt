Why?

I don\'t wanna live,
I wanna die.
Sometimes I love the live,
But not now,
Everbydoy are dying around me,
Why?
Why everybody exept me?

I hate to be alone,
And I hate to be with someone
What can I do?
Why do I think so much about death?
I hate it!
But I can\'t stop!
This thought always come back!
