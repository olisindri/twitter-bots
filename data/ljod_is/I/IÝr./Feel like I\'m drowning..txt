Feel like I\'m drowning.

Feel like I\'m drowning in my thoughts,
And it\'s all about the death.
Don\'t know why,
I\'m curious and shy.

Try to stop thinking,
But I can\'t.
Everything is going on in my life,
Things that I don\'t understand.

Everybody are trying to help,
But nobody can.
Don\'t know what\'s wrong,
But I\'m drowning.
