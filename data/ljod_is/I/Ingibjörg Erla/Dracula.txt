Dracula

Eyes, red like the blood dripping from his lips,
Hair long and midnight black.
He follows you into the woods.
You nrun, you cry, you try to hide,
But he will always find you.
He approaches.
Horror fills your tearful eyes as the man,
No, the monster,
Leans against your neck.
A stab of pain.
You try to fight but he will not let you go.
For he is death on wings, Satan\'s song he sings.
He is the one who will make you quiver.
He is Dracula.
