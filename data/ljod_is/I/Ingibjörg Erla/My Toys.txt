My Toys

Wanna see my butcher knife?
It’s really sharp and shiny.
But when I pet my cat with it,
She gets really whiny.

I also have a big red axe,
And red’s my favourite colour.
Maybe I would show you why,
If I were a tad bit taller.

But I guess my favourite is the noose,
Wanna try it on?
Don’t worry, I won’t cut you loose,
Nobody will notice you’re gone.
