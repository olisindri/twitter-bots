Jane Doe

I hate you, I hate you
I honestly do
Some day you'll find me
Sitting in your favorite chair
Only to find me totally empty

Hello, my name is Jane
I am the neutral woman
From the neutral planet 1
Modern, regular, Husband, 2,5 children
Everyone's asleep by 10 pm

You took me away
From my loved ones
Even farther away from you
Who could really want
This kind of perfection?

Modern every day art home
Regular 7 o'clock dinner
Husband, 2,5 children and a dog
Everyone's asleep by 10 pm
Did I always love you?
Do I want this kind of perfection?
Was this really my dream?
