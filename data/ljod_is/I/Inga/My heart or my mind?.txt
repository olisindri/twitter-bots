My heart or my mind?

My heart or my mind
 
 
I didin’t know what i had until i lost u
But our relationship was quite bad
I felt so abused!
I’m lying here so really sad 
With my heart broken
And my arms wide open
Knowing that u wont come back.
The future is so black
U used to protect me
I felt so save with u!
Now who will come instead of U?
I’ve lost so much I didn’t deserve U
U need something so much more
Something that I cant give U
Not even my love can give U what U need!
I’ve lost something that my mind doesn’t want here
But my heart needs U!
What is stronger my heart or my mind?
