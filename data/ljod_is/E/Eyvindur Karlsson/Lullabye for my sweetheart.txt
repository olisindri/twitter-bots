Lullabye for my sweetheart

Sleep, my love, sleep.
Sleep through the noise and the racket.
I shall watch over you,
and watch your precious gold.
Sleep, my love, sleep tight.
Sleep through this fog that surrounds us.
Don\'t think my love, just sleep.
I will run my fingers through your hair,
and sing for you, until you sleep.
Sleep, my dear love,
for today there is no existance,
nothing can harm you.
Sleep today, my love, and I will watch over you
until you wake.
