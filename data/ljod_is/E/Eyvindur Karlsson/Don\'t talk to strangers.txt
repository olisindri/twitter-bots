Don\'t talk to strangers

Don\'t talk to strangers, my dear.
Remember the little girl in the pink dress
who accepted candy from the big, strange man?
She\'s dead now,
raped and mutilated in the alley
where they found her three days later.
Remember the boy who just wanted a ride home?
The man seemed friendly enough,
but now that boy is in a wheelchair.
He drools,
and sometimes falls asleep into his supper.
So don\'t talk to strangers, love.
You might wind up wishing you had just
kept on walking in the cold,
maybe you could have done without that candy.
But what you really have to remember, dear,
is that the biggest, scariest stranger,
is you...
