One more step

One more step.
Just one more step
into the light,
and I can see.
One more step
that begins an endless journey.
A journey of a million miles
begins with this one.
One more step
into the exposing light
shows me heaven
and I am born again.
And this one step,
into oblivion,
I want to take
with you.
