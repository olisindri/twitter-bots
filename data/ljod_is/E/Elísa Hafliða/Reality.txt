Reality

All of my life
I\'ve been hoping for a dream.
A dream to come true,
an angel to give me strength
through life 
and infinity

secretly i\'ve been hiding,
hiding my power to survive.
Hiding my believing to the world

Someday I\'ll make a difference,
saveing the world.
Let them know
whatever happens,
it\'s their destiny.
