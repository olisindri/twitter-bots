Even angels fall....

So beautiful and peaceful
they all smile so nicely to you
The look of these eyes
So bright and clear 

But even angels fall
Make mistakes and cry
There are angels with no smile
There are angels, with a broken heart

So beautiful and peaceful
They all seem so happy
But some angels have sorrow
Angels that donÂ´t like \"tomorrow\"

Even angels fall and die......
