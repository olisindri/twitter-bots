The Last Session

Time to go
Let yourself flow
I\'ll lead you to a new home

No sunshine in his wasteland\'s sand. 
The ray that he held in his hand, 
Gone the day he lost his mind. 
This precious thought that he can\'t find

Distant place
Different ways
Gaze through glass
Face to face

Burnt and embraced
Lies at last

No sunshine in his wasteland\'s sand. 
The ray that he held in his hand, 
Gone the day he lost his mind. 
This precious thought that he can\'t find

Step back and take my hand
I will show you the desert band
Hold me close and hold me tight
Letâ€™s get ready for your last flight
