Way Out

I am only floating around without minding what takes place.
The circulation goes on and on and the earth spins round again 
At light speed now and then.
I spread my wings and fly away from all the screaming fuss, 
I know I have my reasons but I’m still not quite sure why.
I guess I just like to float around in the eternal state of mind 
As I have a home in another zone where there’s one thing that I know.
The unknown doesn’t even know what knowledge is about 	
And sometimes I wonder when reality will come and knock on my door.
This is how I found my passion for philosophy of life
I can’t help that I love the psychedelic delicious kiss 
In this tenderly tempting kingdom of me.
Inside of my head I like to be with my thoughts where the grass is green 
And you know what I mean.
