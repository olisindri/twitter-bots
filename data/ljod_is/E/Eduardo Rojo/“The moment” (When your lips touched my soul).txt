“The moment” (When your lips touched my soul)

I was captured in nightmares so deep, so black…
Is the love that left in me a mark…
Is love that for so long had lacked…
And there are you emerging from the fog

And you sit beside me
And take me out of my hive
Give sense to my life
And you kiss me and I’m healed
Please stay close, stay here
Kiss me again, kiss me please
Go back in time to the moment
When your lips touched my soul
And make it never, never stop
And I’ll kiss you with body and mind
‘Coz you opened the eyes of this blind
And I’ll kiss you with skin and heart
‘Coz you find the silk between tons of lead
And for you I’ll work hard to do things right
‘Coz you’ve been so lovely so nice
Hold me softly, hold me tight
And you, sweetly enjoy of my heart every slice

And my heart one more time has shrine
Your sweet smell when I taste wine
Your presence in my poems, in every line
The needing of making you mine
The peace of your light
And slowly you discovered my real smile…
