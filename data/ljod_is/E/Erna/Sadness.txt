Sadness

Sometimes I feel lonely
And pain inside my heart
My true wish is only
That we won?t be apart

Why did you have to go?
So far away from me?
Don?t you see I need you so?
But I have to set you free

My tears are running down my chin
I?m angry, I?m so sad
Did I do some kind of sin?
To deserve to feel so bad?

I know you?re watching over me
I know you miss me too
And in my heart you?ll always be
No matter what, it?s true!
