Your words

Your words weigh heavily on my chest.
I try to take a breath,
but the breath is not clean.
I try to shrug them away,
but they will not leave.

They burn in my mind and in my heart.
I never dreamed that we would soon part.
Thoughts become cloudy,
the words are too heavy.
I cry into the night.
