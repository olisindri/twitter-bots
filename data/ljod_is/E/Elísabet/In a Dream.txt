In a Dream

The sand warms my body
The grains tinkle into every nook,
every cranny.
I turn around to face the sky
as the sun is falling.
I miss him.
I had wanted him to make love to my skin
Now I must settle.

...

You give me your touch
and I accept
with a sigh.
The moon observes our games
with one eye
And the night quickly passes us by.

...

I awake as my lover returnes come morn.
I feel ashamed
and more than a little torn.
