So Blue

I guess some people are
bound to dream a dream they
can never have
Come true.

I guess some people
are destined to live a 
life that before they've begun
Is through.

I guess I should not 
hope to someday, somehow
Have you.

But people have always 
wished for the undoable, 
dreamed for the impossible
and sometimes
Dreams come true.

I guess for now I will 
just have to love with
a heart that is alone.
So blue.
