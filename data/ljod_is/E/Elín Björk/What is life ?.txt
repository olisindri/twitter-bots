What is life ?

What is this life ? 
I am not sure .. 
People is hurt 
People cry 
But they donâ€™t know really why
Someone cry because of love
But I cry because my soul is empty.

My heart is a big black hole 
And I cant do anything
My brain is frozen just like my heart
Why cant the word be wonderful 
And nobody will cry 
And nobody die
