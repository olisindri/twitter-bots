Why ?

Why do I love you so much ? 
Why can’t you just love me like I love you ?
I need you, you are my love
You said you had to think about it  
I think you don’t like me like I like you 
It´s so fucking hard to think about you
You with some other girl 
Maybe better girl then me 
Why am I thinking like this ?
God help me help me help me 
Im praying I need your help now
Not to morrow now!!! 

You know I like you 
But I don’t know why I like you
Maybe are you just like other boys
Who know ? not me ! 
I’m sure god that I will lose him
I know you can’t let him love me
but maybe give me another chance
to show him who I am 

Now I’m crying 
I just want you to me
You said now that you cant
Be In love with a person
That you can’t see every day
I love you , but you don’t love me
I don’t need you this is my life
I think that I can life with out you!!!
Good bye!..
