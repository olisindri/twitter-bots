Everything is beautiful in black and white

You thougth you were pretty in pink,
your pitch black hair was fair
and all you knew was being loved
but the others said you ugly,
you knew it wasn´t true
you just had a dream that would
never come true
and you knew that:
everybody is beautiful in black and white
everybody is loveing on the inside
that wasn´t enough for you
so you asked your self 
where should you hide from this misery,
wicked reality this loveing fantasy?
Now were your pills done
and mama needs to buy more bags
you lost your grip of reality
and sliped into your black and white fantasy
where everything is beautiful
and you where beautiful in black and white
