No Name #1

imagine your life at it is 
not worth takin the risk
it dosen´t seem like nothing 
but it is

What will you do?
when you have no longer a bottle to protect you
and your pills are gone too
you don´t see the world as it was
when your love ones are fadeing away
than you don´t give a shit

You think what is the world comming to
and kepps the delusion on 
that you are great
and we are all dumb

so what are you?
