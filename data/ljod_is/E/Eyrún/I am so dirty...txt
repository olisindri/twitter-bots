I am so dirty..

I am so dirty on the inside
I feel nothing but my hate
My sweet, you try so hard to save me
My love, it\'s 15 years too late.

My bloody eyes shine in the darkness
Of my soul, my destiny to die
My sweet, you can say you\'d miss me
My love, I know you\'d only lie.

I am so dirty on the inside
My mind, my soul all covered up in dirt
My sweet, if you knew what I have been through
My love, if you knew how life can hurt.
