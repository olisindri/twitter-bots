in fact

In fact
as soon
as your
dance
has been
set off
you are
already
cold again.
But you struggle
with your fingers
through
the ice
and you spell
an unknown name
to the audience

And they can´t
do anything
because they´ve
paid for
the seats
and they
will have to
swallow almost
anything that
is warm
because they feel
pain from the 
cold sounds
of the ice.

You don´t
have to struggle
anymore
because your face
and 
the
sound of your smile
is making everyone
silence.
So now
you have a minute just for yourself.
 

Take the
orange
circle,
take the
foolwalk
Do whatever
you desire
The audience
have paid
their
tickets 
to see
your show
and you are
fooling them
with very
old tricks.
Tricks that
remind yourself
of your 
great grandmother.


You can have
a total
blackout
on the stage
because you are
a charmer
that will always
remind people
of death.

You are 
a long dead
bad smelling rat.
