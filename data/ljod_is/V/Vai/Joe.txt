Joe

With a sense of wonder and childlike awe
he?ll many questions ask
For he knows the process of growing up
is a never ending task

A ray of light in our dreary lives,
a fountain of wisdom and joy
This grey haired guy who reminds us all
of an energetic boy

He never really shuts his gob
He laughs like no one can
I hope I?ll do as good a job
of becoming an older man
