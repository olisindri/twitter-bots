To go in life.

Standing here alone,
wondering were
to go in life.
He comes to me
and we look into
each others eyes,
and think about
the same.

Touching my face,
telling me how
beautiful I am.
I don´t know if 
to believe him.
Telling me he wouldn´t
want to be anywhere
else then with me.

Standing here
two of us, wondering
were to go in life.
Willingly, shyly touching
each other gently.
Looking into each others
eyes, telling one another
how much we love each other.
