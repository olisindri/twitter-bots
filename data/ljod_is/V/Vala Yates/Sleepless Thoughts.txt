Sleepless Thoughts

I know
I should be sleeping.
-But I’m not.

I am obsessed
by my thoughts.
Surrounded
by my being.

Need
to get out.
Away
from my thoughts.
My world.
My being.

All I know 
I can’t stop thinking.

Thinking
about nothing.
And everything.

Worrying about everything.
And nothing.

I just want to rest.
