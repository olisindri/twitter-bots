I need your love

I need your love,
I want your kiss.
To feel your touch.
And that look.

When I met you,
your smile never left
your face..
You took me in 
your arms,
and kissed me.
You told me that 
you loved me.

Now your gone.
I look in your face.
Your blanc.
I hug you with love.
You donâ€™t. 
I kiss you In Love.
You won\'t.

I tell you that
I love you.

I want your love back.
Just tell me that 
you love me...
