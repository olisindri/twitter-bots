Weeping Willow

Weeping Willow.
Sitting in the park.
Gracefull – Determined.
Beautiful.

Looking
to the sky.
Sun is smiling.
Knowing
She’s so Beautiful.

Looking
to the ground.
Flowers smiling.
Knowing
She’s so Graceful.

Looking
round the park.
People staring
- children pointing.
Knowing 
She’s so charming.

Strawberry.
Beautiful and sweet.
Glancing out
to the world.

Dusting the dirt away.
Looking
at the sky.
Smiling.

Sun is smiling.
Not meant for her.

Flowers smiling.
People staring,
children pointing.
Not meant for her.

Weeping Willow
sitting happy.
Meant for her.

Strawberry lying 
alone in the shadow.

Weeping Willow 
laughing, knowing 
She’s so Perfect.
