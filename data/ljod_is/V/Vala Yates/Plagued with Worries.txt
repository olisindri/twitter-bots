Plagued with Worries

I lie in my bed
and think about my life.

I lie but I do not sleep.
I am plagued with worries.
Worries about you.
Do you still love me?
I wonder...

I sleep. 
I sleep but I do not rest.
I am plagued with thoughts.
Thoughts 
that turn to dreams.
Dreams 
that turn to nightmares.
I am plagued with worries.
I sleep 
but I do not rest.

I lie in bed.
But I do not sleep...
I am plagued with worries...
