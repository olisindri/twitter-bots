Chaotic Paranoia II

I the chaos.
You stability.

What I miss
you have.
What you miss
I have.

Together 
we are strong.

...

I am alone.
I no more 
have you.
No more stability.  

I lose 
my head.

I ask 
for help..
I need you.

Make us strong.

The bond
is breaking...
getting weaker..
by the minute..

I ache
for you..
need 
to see you.

I will lose you.

The bond will break.

And I will again
be floating
alone 
in the nothingness
of life.

Being
But not living.  

I need you.
Please...
