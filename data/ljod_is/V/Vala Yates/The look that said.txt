The look that said

Do you want
me
to know
you love me?

Do you want 
me
to feel safe?

Do you want 
me
to love you?

You don’t need
to tell me
every day
that you love me.

You don’t need
to give me
flowers
or diamonds.

You don’t need
to write me
a poem.

All I want.

All I need.

Look at me.

Look at me
as you used to.

Look into
my eyes
with the passion
as before.

Look at me.
And look
into
my soul.

That look.

The look 
that said
I love you.
