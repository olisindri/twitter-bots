Changes

I\'m getting up from bed
ringing in my head
alarm\'s having a fit
-So I\'m playing dead

Wanna sleep some more
God, I\'m such a bore
-Set it to \"a bit\"
and wake up in four..

..Couldn\'t the Sun
just wait a minute more?

-World is what it is...

I\'m rushing up to school
but feel like such a fool
I\'m late again!
-It seams to be a rule

But that\'s not half of all
I need to do much more
Get to work, 
and work and work lots more..

..Couldn\'t the Time 
just wait a minute more?

-Life is what it is...

I should\'ve got up 
earlier
I should\'ve eaten 
healthier
Should not have staid up 
late!

I wish I was more
organized
I wish I was more
energized
I wish I wasn\'t 
always late..

..Couldn\'t I 
just do a bit more
right?

-I am what I am...
