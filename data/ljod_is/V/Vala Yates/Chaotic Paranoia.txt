Chaotic Paranoia

I am the chaos.
You the stability.

What I am missing
you have.
What you are missing
I have.

Together 
we are stronger.

Now
I am alone.
I no longer have you.
No longer stability.  

I think I am losing 
my mind.

I am asking 
for your help.
I need your help.

Make us strong again.

The bond between us
is breaking.
Getting weaker
by the day.

I need 
to see you.

Or I will lose you.

The bond will break.

And I will again
be floating
alone 
in the nothingness
of life.

Being
But not living.  

I need you.
Please..
help me.
