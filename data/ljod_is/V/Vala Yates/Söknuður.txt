The Sorrow
is like a stone,
sitting
in my stomach,
hard and heavy.

Missing.

I remember
when you were here.

The little church
in the centre of town,
and the hospital
on your way.
Now I don’t go there
anymore.

Your first job,
when you walked
across Kópavogur,
and everyone thought you were 
insane.

Sometimes I gave you 
a lift half way,
and kissed you goodbye..
..but met you that same night.

Months pass by
and I don’t get to see
your smile.

I hear your voice
sometimes
on the phone.

Only thing left for me
now
are memories
and hope
that maybe someday soon
we will again be
together.

And I can whisper
that I love you,
and feel like
never again will I
be alone.
I’ll get to rest
in your arms.
Happy.
Home.
