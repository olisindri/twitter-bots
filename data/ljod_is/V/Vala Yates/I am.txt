I am

Friend.

What makes a friend?

The one you know?
The one you care about?
The one you trust?

The one
who’s company
you seek?

Friend.
You are
a friend.

You don’t need
to take space
in my life.

You give me something
special.
I can.
when you are near
I am.

I don’t need to try
I already am.
