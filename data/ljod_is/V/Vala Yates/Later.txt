Later

The earth
quietly
sleeping.
White 
snow-blanket 
keeping it warm.

Warm glow
of the night
shining
in the cold.

Sitting
in the warm
darkness.
Beautiful music
surrounding. 

Soul breathing.
Smiling.

You are away.
Across the sea.

Although,
I do not cry.

Your red
closeness 
keeping me warm
in the dark.

Heart pumping
in my face.

Hope smiling
in my heart.

Later...
