Is love?

Love...
What is love?
Is it..
attraction
or is it comfort?
To feel safe?
Fulfilling the need of belonging?

To love...
Is it
to care?

Do you need company?
Looking for friendship?
Don’t want
to be alone?

Or is it love?

Don’t go sliding away
don’t go looking for love
don’t keep wanting to belong!
Just be happy with what you’ve got!

What is love?

Is love?
