Splitting Heartache

My head is splitting.
My stomack bursting.
My eyes are crying.

My soul is aching
My spirit screaming.
My heart is braking.

How can the cause
of all this
be you?

You 
that once gave me 
so much joy
and endless love.

Where did it go?

How can you leave me
alone
crying 
in the shadow?

With no hope left?
No joy?
No love?

You 
that once gave me
so much strength,
have now left me
with none.

It was you
who gave me love.

And it was you
who took it away.

(So where do I go from here?)
