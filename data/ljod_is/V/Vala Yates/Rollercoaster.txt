Rollercoaster

Pitchblack darkness.

Sound of games
surrounding.

I am stuck
in the seat.
Sencing you
behind me.

The wind blowing
-removing me-

-I start slipping
away..


..My heart pumping.


-Silence-

for a moment


-Then-

I feel your hands
gripping my shoulders.
Your arms
hugging my heart.

And again we are
one
