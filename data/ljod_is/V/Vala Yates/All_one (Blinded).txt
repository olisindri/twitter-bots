All/one (Blinded)

No
it can\'t be
I don\'t see
how you could leave me
all alone
in the dark
when you said
that you loved me
I can\'t see

My love 
for you
runs deeper

You are my friend
my companion
my soulmate

It can\'t be

My love
for you
will never let go
of me

I 
will never let go
of you

I don\'t see
how you could leave me
all alone
