The little things

Like sitting
in the sofa.
Cuddling,
chocolate
and movies.

Now I do it alone.

Getting drunk.
Talking about everything,
and feeling
the hazy love
and passion.

Being hungover.
Sleeping all day,
watching tv
and eating.

Waking up
early with the sun.
Having tea
and ab-mj√≥lk, 
with musli.

Now
I do it all alone.
