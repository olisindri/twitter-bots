Someday

I’m lying in bed,
with the light switched off.
But there’s one thing that’s missing..
..you.

All I have
are my thoughts now.
Wordless poems
that float around my brain.
Flashbacks,
from when you were with me.
Memories,
that yet have not happened.
Creations of my mind,
wishes
of something
we might have had.
Or may get to have.
But one thing is for sure..
we do not have it now...

You
making a smowman
with Rögnvaldur
at Christmass.

-when I
fell in love with you
a little more-

Us 
having a barbeque
in Akureyri,
with dad and Raggi.

-The sunniest day
made it 
the best day-

You
meeting me
at Waterloo,
and taking the tube
together.

- That was never lonely-

Us 
going to Zizzi’s
for a veggie calzone.

-For the sixtyeth time- 

Us
Going to see Hamlet
At the Old Vic.

-When you
met my mum
for the first time-
....................................

Us together
in England,
owning a home 
together

-Maybe even
a baby-

You asking
For my hand

-And the wedding-

You knowing
Icelandic.
And working
in Iceland.

-Us living in Iceland
together-

Me 
having a gig.
Being a singer.

-And you
standing proud
in the audience-

If only
this love
will stay
in our vains,

Maybe
we can
have those things 
someday.
