Think about me?

How do you feel
when you think
about me?

Does my beauty
amaze you?
Does my body
excite you?
Does the thought
of you kissing me
make you quiver?

Does your heart
skip a beat?
Does your stomach 
jump?

Do you stop what youâ€™re doing
and think
about me?
Think how much
you love me?

I know
you used to...
