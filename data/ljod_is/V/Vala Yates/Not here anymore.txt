Not here anymore

Seems like yesterday 
I rode my bike down the street
Screaming with joy.

Seems like yesterday
I looked at my sister
-red hair and blue eyes-
for the first time

Seems like yesterday
I watched astupid movie
With my friends,
eating microwave popcorn.

Where am I now?
Not here anymore
-That’s for sure...

Seems like yestersday
I watched my sister
dancing in a new dress
with her best friend

Seems like yesterday
I pulled down my pants
and mooned the street
as people walked by my window

Seems like yesterday
I felt so lucky
as I kissed a girl
for the first time

Where am I now?
Not here anymore
-That’s for sure...

Seems like yesterday
I smiled at the future
-Happy
about what was to come....

Where am I now?
Not here anymore
-That’s for sure...
