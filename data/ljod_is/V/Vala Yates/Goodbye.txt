Goodbye

Maybe this
what I feel 
inside
is not enough

Knowing you
love me too
-not enough

Feeling pain
when I think
about you
leaving my life
for good

Maybe I
should say goodbye
for you
to feel alive 
again

Maybe I 
will feel alive
as well

So Goodbye 
for the rest of time

Goodbye for the rest of time.
