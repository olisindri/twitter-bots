Soulless TV

Sometimes I think
the TV
is the work of the devil.
Put here on earth
to trick us
to be lazy.
Steal our souls.

“Turn it on...”
“You know you want to...”

“All your worries
will away...”

“Happy..
Forever happy...
and laughter...”

without meaning

You are staring.
Staring
at the screen.
The lifeless screen.
It’s flashing.
Unknown figures
moving,
talking.

You are staring
the night away.
Staring
the day away.

Alone sits
the body.
Motionless
empty
soulless
sad.

So let me ask you this:

-What is the point?
