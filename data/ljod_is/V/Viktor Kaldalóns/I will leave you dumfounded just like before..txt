I will leave you dumfounded just like before.

"What to such as you anyhow such a poet as I? therefore leave my works, 
And go lull yourself with what you can understand, and with piano-tunes, 
For I lull nobody, and you will never understand me." -Walt Whitman. 


The boundless guessing of who I am, where my words are created, 
where my strings show its real tune and blossom, 
thrive in a flaw I say, yet hidden in mute, 
you could ever raise your voice, I will not answer, 
the respond you are seeking is not here, nor will ever be, 
for this is me, the only way for me, to be someone you are not, 
so step into silence, my dear, this is hopeless, 
for my sentences will ever be against your will and mind, 
ordain you the slave, the pinion of me will prevail, fathomless.
