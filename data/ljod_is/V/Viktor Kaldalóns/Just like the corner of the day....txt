Just like the corner of the day...

... And now we are lower than we lay.


Undermost, wall-to-wall, our heads hang low.
Heavily they hover;
spilling feverish droplets from the
darkest clouds onto the foreground.
"How can they be so heavy?"
They wheeze! They wheeze!
"O! The stupor is exhaling."
They are chugging towards
the bluish wheelbarrows.
Whilst we park under, in vain.
(--Where´s the rain?)
The first, the second,
and the third day in a row we rede;
"Ms. Mater; We are dying! Give us relief!"
And the streets are on fire.
--And the streets are on fire.
And the buildings, oh,
they are like black diamonds.

(In the rain we´ll dance.
--But where´s the rain?)


And now we are lower than the day we died.
