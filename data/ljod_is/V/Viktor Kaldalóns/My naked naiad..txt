My naked naiad.

And the future hold on planning a home, 
idea roaming in the garden, 
round and lush as the ripest pear, 
succulent, yet the violence that we fear. 

We, the outsiders on the avenue, 
down-and-out´s of you, the city, 
among her, the by-and-by of our tall love, 
candied oh, it feels as mourn in disguise. 

The whole clouds of Misses falling, 
the circumstance of clasp and daily tallying, 
the minute of you gliding, 

a diurnal breeze embracing remarkably, 
deathless, the skies meet deeply. 

The darkest deed will remain unlocked, 
yet we wander through and through, 
on our poor legs still running, 
squarely we´ll stand victorious 
from a high-spread gnu and all lulling. 

A nymph of fairy-tales and unborn suns, 
such purity wont lose its voice, 
bird call it is, monochord of you and me, 
this is, my dear, our bound of harmony. 

My love, I assure you, 
I will plan a duo, and you will reach a tune. 

And just like the mimes, they do not speak, 
but form their mouths, around a kiss, 
this holy sentence; "I love you," 
is just another act of self-destruction. 

This is just another act, milady.
