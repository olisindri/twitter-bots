Upstream they went towards the valley.

Through long abandoned levels and roads they went,
rushing, yet they wake no sleeper.
You may hear the colors rising louder,
O so quietly they go. Into the churchyard,
the airy kisses from an golden yew,
the billboards read between the lines,
my dear, indeed their signs show us love;
they care for the future of this city
whose O so in blossom this spring.
Ring! Ring the bells! Rose-pedals on thousand floors,
silver strings of all instruments agree.
With every step a heart anews.
