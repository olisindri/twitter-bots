Contiguous grapevine, old and all around.

A lily attached to her hair, shaping the heartlands,
lulling all public meetings; the speaker is offically dead,
gladly paused and stared. The Blues gives a smile,
until these fingertips have reached a mile.
Yesterday´s thunders rumbling in the sky,
they won´t be heard for her beauty shouts louder,
--they won´t even try.
