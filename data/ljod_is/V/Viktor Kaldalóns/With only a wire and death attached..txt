With only a wire and death attached.

Scarce are the visitors under this skylight,
in a sudden, a dismount I heard, a maiden shared a breeze,
summary she was and raucous,
so distinctly supine´s on the living quarters.

'Well-met, stranger, how may I velvet you?'
Her clothes were abstracted with moiré,
yet so mouldy and pallid, ever so unacquainted.
I doubt this moment even today,

rancorous, so rancorous she was,
she didn´t speak at all.
Yet her utterance through a regard and skin,
plead for her a mile long geste.

Of death and sorrow and things to come,
about a spindly road and lowering floors,
in the darkling, quiet yet wailing,
this hearsay people´s alway drawing.

The completion of the raw quick;
the antiparallel wave is us,
wrought from distance and vicinity,
yet the midst is ever so far.

'See these lines, this air floating through and through,
these strings; we stand on them.
Do you notice how comfortable it is...
the ground?'

We won´t be here forever,
alas, it´s not even here.
