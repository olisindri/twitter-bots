Pharisaic lifetime of a saint.

And the whole house could have burned,
a little part of today
is now way too much for those who care,

we should have burned inside.

The clock nearly ticking its way out,
in the kitchen, a church basement,
below the elderly need of time,

and its epoch stopped and stared.

Should we really care?

We surely need a comforter in this town,
girl, this is wakefulness we enshrine,
in all its story, the holy glory,

of a man walking upon life without an end.

Should we start over again?

Proceed your age,
give me a first aid,
for IÂ´m semisacred.
