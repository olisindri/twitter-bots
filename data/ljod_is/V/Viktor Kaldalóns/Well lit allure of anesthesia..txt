Well lit allure of anesthesia.

From part one up to ten,
itÂ´s a journey about a dead man,

walking the end, bespattering the blue,
sometimes we die more than death asks us to.

The ting, oh the bells ting,
you should be ready,

our love-battle fleet at anchor in the bay.

Now dwell in a pillion of me,
sweet railyards are approaching,

the Lamppost march-past stirring,
Death! Dance with me!
