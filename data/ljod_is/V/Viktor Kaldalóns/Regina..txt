Regina.

The king has a lousy six dollar whore in his bed.
His kingdom crowned with dead flowers bought from the stock market,
which are merchandised by thieves and murderers,
all in one singing in a drunken comatose of a whopping quackery;
"Oh, we don´t loathe the alcohol! Must love the alcohol!"
--On and on and on...
With pulpy graylings sleeping on the walls,
stargazers bawl upon the new grown western towns.
There´s a backstop
with sentences so small,
they only come out in the filmy lower-cases,
never to be read by a proper reader, or by anyone.

"You´re not my hero, actually you´re kind of a tramp,
but I love you, for you´re my queen... but then again,
our sexlife could be better."

On the same minute he´s shouting bitterly in his realm.
"I am the monarch, you are my queen.
I must say we were never ment to be."
