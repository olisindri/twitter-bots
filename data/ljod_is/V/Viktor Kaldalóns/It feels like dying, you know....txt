It feels like dying, you know...

Oh well, it could be worse. We are sitting above every tower watching our hope losing its dignity, that´s the bright side, yeah we got one honey. Not only we can see it, we are living with our grandmothers drinking red wine while the lost ones are drinking the last drop from this desert of mine. Six minutes is like the neverending story of hours passing days... can you imagine the night crossing years? Oh well, the parade will survive this land, the miles spreading wide, they are not home yet and never will... oh, no. I´m not sure about you, but I´m getting a bit tired of the loss of friendships while there´s none. Long gone they walk, and they are still walking. I will watch, yeah, I will watch them. And the dying ebullience, we should call for an ambulance. Do you really think they´ll learn from it? Do you really think it would be worth it? The ton is careening on its left side, and it tumbles in its self. And by the rite they are building fires... there´s no bourn in sight. There´s no rooftops, only the red sky reflecting the color of this shoreless clime. 

Sarah? Are you still with me? 
John! Where´s my whiskey? 

And, John! One more thing... pick up the phone and call for a fleeting succor. I´m having some struggles with this world.
