Just like the corner of all nights.

Lazily my shoulders grow within the snow.
O! Can you see them grow!
(See them grow!)
Before the sombre´s storm!
O! Can you see them grow!
Before the rising tide.
(See them grow!)
Before the blackest volley.
Dear noblewoman! Dear nobleman!
Before it gets dark!

"Turn the lights off, my dearest.
You´ve seen enough."

Mr. Lantern! A demise! 

"Death; You! The ripper! Slay my light!"



(We have often heard strange sounds coming out from the valley of death.)
