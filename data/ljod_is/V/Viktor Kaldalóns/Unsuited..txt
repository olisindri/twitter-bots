Unsuited.

The fallen archangel with flattened wings,
one who couldn´t bear, O in Heaven they sing.
An outlaw lonesome he plays on his strings,
O the blackest harp he owns with pride.
mooching around down under,
living in a two men´s grave,
lonely, always will be, having only a man
and wife by his side, both past away.
