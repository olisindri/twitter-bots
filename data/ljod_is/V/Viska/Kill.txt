Kill

Asking all those questions
never finding an answer
hurting eating my heart
just a little bit by bit

So much pain and hurting
never understanding why
just wanting an answer
to where, when and why

My very own sadness drowning me
dragging me down step my step
listening to everything
trying to make sence out of it

I scream out my questions
not so silent any more
I need to know to live
how to stop killing myself
