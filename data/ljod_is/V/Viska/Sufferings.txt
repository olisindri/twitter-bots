Sufferings

All the suffering that I have gone through
I have gone through them all because of you
You made my life way to hard to live
What gives you the right to do that

You have been here from before days
You could have chose another
But you made me to take this into my life
All you suffers are now mine

When you visited my mother in her dreams
You knew that she would have one for you
One that was born in love but in vain
You had to get one of children of the rainbow

I believed that I could get free
But it would have been to easy
I must finish some of that you begun
But am I strong enough to finish it all for you
