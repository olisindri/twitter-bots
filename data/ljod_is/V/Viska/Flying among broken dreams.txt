Flying among broken dreams

I feel my broken Wings
I try to fly
How can I fly with wings so broken
How much I want to die

Once I felt the wind beneath my wings
Once I flew on the great open sky
But then I crashed, crashed to die
But I want to live, want to fly

With sorrows so deep I couldn\'t fly
with tears in my eyes I couldn\'t see
I went down, down to thee
I cannot fly with wings so broken

Only my soul is meant to fly
Only you can help me up
An angel at her mothers side
An angel that once was mine
