Thoughts

I close my eyes, kneel and say a pray
That I shall not loose you one good day
To my life you brought hope and faith
Now I am not so alone, cast away
For you I have so much deep care
But don\'t know if you truly want me there
Of trusting and caring I have always been afraid
But for you I am ready to wait
