Silent Moonlight

Silent is the moonlight
The moonlight makes my way so clear
So easy to travel through to unseen worlds
To the worlds that only exist in my lonely life
The Moonlight keeps me company by being so silent
There for I need to be alone
But I am to afraid to walk my way, my path alone
You silent moonlight helps me to face my world
My followers and all my shadows
