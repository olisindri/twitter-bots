Farside corner

Crying in a farside corner
listening to the words I want to say
writing my mind when I see the paper
with the tears flowing in my eyes

I doubt my reasons
I doubt what I truly am
I doubt that I can stand alone
I doubt that I can overcome this fear

Knowing that I am not save
thinking of getting away, to escape
getting to a save place I know
so far away but so close

My doubts are so clear
My fear is in the open
My thoughts flying around
My fear swirls in my mind

Thinking that maybe I am not alone
but deep inside I know better
I am always alone when I have fear
deep inside I also know that I have you

I throw away my pen
I cast away my fears
I push away my book
I dry away my tears

Sinking into myself
I try to swim away
knowing that I am strong
stronger then I thought at first.
