The sad poem

I have been worried and I have been sad
I have been unhappy and I have been glad
I have felt like I should open up
But like a door I close again
Maybe I need someone with a proper key
But with small hands to help my door slowly opens
I feel as I can break free but when shall it be
I neither can or want to stand alone
I sit by the phone ready to make a call
But what if my call is unwelcome
Maybe it is not but maybe it is
I in a fright close my door again
I close my eyes do not want to see
I hold my ears because I do not want to hear the child crys
But I try to speak and ask it to let me be
Maybe this child was never meant to be just like me
