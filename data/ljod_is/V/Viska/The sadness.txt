The sadness

My daughter, my daughter
look this child
he has no one to love him
his mother has died
his father has vanished
remember the sadness
you see in his eyes

There no one to hold him
no one to love him
no one to warm his cold hands
look at his clothes
look at his hair
remember what you see
because it is all there

Children are not all
as lucky as you
to have a mother that loves you
and a father to
remember the sadness
you see in his eyes
because it is all there

Mother, ohh mother
can\'t we take him home
to love him and cherish
to make him feel so loved
is there nothing I can do
is there no one to help
why is there no one to help

Is there nothing I can do
no child should suffer this much
he has no one to love
there no one to help him
can\'t we take him home
I looked in his eyes
it makes me so sad

My father would love him
my mother wouldn\'t you
I don\'t want him to suffer
I don\'t want him to be alone
there must be something
that I can do
help me my mother

My daughter, my daughter
I am glad that your heart
is filled with all this love
let\'s go and warm his hands
let\'s ask if we can help
remember the sadness
clearing out of his eyes
