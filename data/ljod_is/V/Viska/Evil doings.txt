Evil doings

I am lost, waiting to be found
Hidding in the shadows so the man won\'t see me
Mommy... daddy where are you?
I\'ve tried to call but you don\'t seem to hear me,
you were at home when the doorbell rang,
I heard you let someone in... was it the boogeyman?
Mom... where are you?
Daddy, scare him away... I don\'t like him,
I am scared! I don\'t want him to dry my tears away!
Mommy! Daddy!

Come out, come out where ever you are...
I got some sweets for you little girl.
