Just for you

I dont want to cry
but still I do
I cry for what I lost
but I lost you

There was no reason
no cause
just one big loss
of what I loved

I gave up in a way
but still I look for you
every single day
I promise to you I do

I never wished you away
thought I was unsure, afraid
I never knew what to think, to say
but for you I still await

Over you I had no shame
why is no mistery
I never played that game
pretend to care if I never did

Still today I read what you wrote
so long, long ago to me
you must know I always cared
I just hope that you can see

As I write these words
a memory comes across my mind
of one little kiss I gave you
just to say thanks for being there
