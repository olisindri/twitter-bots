Unknown World

I am alone in a world I don\'t know
Standing on my own feet
With no one to hold on to
Fright swirls in my mind and doubt
Not knowing what to do or think
Doubting every move that I make
Crying in despair for help
Why in the world did I go
Looking at every move as a mistake
Trying to make sence out of everything
Trying to take it day by day
Hoping that time will fly away
Crashing into reality way to hard
Time takes time to pass
Till then I shall be alone
All alone in a world I don\'t know
