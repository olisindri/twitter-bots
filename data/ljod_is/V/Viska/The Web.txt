The Web

I am stuck in a web of lies and suffers
I was given a gift the day I was born
I can see more then a normal person can
I can hear more then a normal person can

This gift hasn't always been for good
There have been so many things that have hunted me
I am not ready for my responsibility but I must
I have made a promise I attend to keep mine
