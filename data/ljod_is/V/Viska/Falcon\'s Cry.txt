Falcon\'s Cry

I hear a distant cry of the falcon
so free and unafraid he is
crossing the sky looking for prey
returning his cry I do

Seeing him coming so close and alone
I spread my wings fly
meting high above I salute him
this brother I lost

I see such sorrow in his eyes
knowing that I am his sister
it is my time to die
hearing his cry as he tears me apart

My brother the beautiful falcon
with sorrow takes my heart
could she not forgive my ignorance
oh mother of the dear Christ
