A little Bird

With every passing day
I hope to send your sadness away
Joy and hope and faith I bring
Like a bird I raise my voice and sing


My wings are broken
I seek your help
With every singles tear
You I show my love and fear


With a little help from you
In the end of summer I shall fly too
Then your children you have a storie to tell
About a little bird you helped to get well


I sit in a tree with my children and tell them of you
Because I shall always remember you too
A woman filled with love and faith
Once one year my life had saved
