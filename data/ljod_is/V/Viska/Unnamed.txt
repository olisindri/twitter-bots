Unnamed

With thoughts so dark
With my mind so clear
With a smile on my lips
With a honor I take a bow

I find my thirst for life
I open my eyes and begin to cry
I with a mind so dark
I cry for all the sufferings you had

An angel you are
A demon I am
A light of life
A light in the dark
