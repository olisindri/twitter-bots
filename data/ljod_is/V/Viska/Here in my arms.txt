Here in my arms

I hold you right here in my arms
watching you talking in sleep
crying for something you had
trying to call out for the

Your crys are burried in my mind
you so afraid of hurting me
never speaking of whats wrong
so I just softly touch your cheek

Me knowing of your painful dreams
wanting to tell you that I am here
just so afraid of pushing you away
because you are just a friend

Unspoken words, a distant cry
our cheeks cheek to cheek
I just want to hold you
right here in my arms
