The Calls From Within

I hear these craving calls inside
The hurting cries
The repeated whys
I heard and suffered
The cries for my trust
The whys for who I am
I am who I am and what I am is I
The fact I did not hear
The fact I did not fear
I was pure but now I am not
The fright of trust
The fright of living
I choose to die but I am still alive
