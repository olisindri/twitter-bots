Shivering Leaves

I feel like a shivering leaf
There has been an intrusion to my existence 

I do not like feeling like this
I do not like have to do this
I do not want to talk about it
I do not like to think about it 

Why did I not protect me
Why did I not run away
Why did I not save myself
Why did the not leave me 

There is a savior
A savior I trust
I cannot save myself
I turn to you
