Shell Fish

Alone I sit and wait for tomorrow,
depressed,
camping in my world of sorrow.
Sailing forward, my ship of sadness,
how long must I go on in the world of madness?

Pain and suffering all around me,
mayhem,
still my blood is the only one i see.
Hoping for a brighter day,
a better world, a better way.
