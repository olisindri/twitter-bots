Not spoken

Few days later,
still haven´t met the god who made her.
Speachless at her presence,
speachless.

I´m the joker,
good for laughs and conversation.
In their eyes nothing else,
nothing growing from that foundation.


The moment you figure out,
that her happiness is what it\'s all about.
You understand your heartache,
means seeing her shell break.
