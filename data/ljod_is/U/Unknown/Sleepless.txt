Sleepless

After all those sleepless thoughts,
and all the pretty things i´ve bought.
I have in me this strangest feeling,
that all this time i´ve been steeling.

I have broken my family´s trust
and stolen my own life´s lust.
Uncertain about my future fights,
praying,
that there wont be more sleepless nights.
