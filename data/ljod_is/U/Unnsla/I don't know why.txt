I don't know why

Look at my aye, you can see me cry
I cry because I loved you once
but it is gone and I don’t know why
Now I have to say goodbye
I don’t understand my self, but I know
you’re not the one, I must love
I know there is more for me
so you can see, I don’t need you anymore
but I care for you, that is fore sure
