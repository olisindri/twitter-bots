The love

Love can hurt
love can be evil
but remember you will fiend
someone to love

You must go on
and remember there is more fish
Do not let the love get over you
dust go on, and I love you!

Remember me, I’m still here
don’t worry, he will come
Wait and see, dust go on
Love is not the life.

Love can hurt
Love can be evil
but it is not the life
you will fiend someone to love…
